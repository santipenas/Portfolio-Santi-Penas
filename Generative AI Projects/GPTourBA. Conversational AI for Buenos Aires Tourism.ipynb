    "# Project: Smart Tourist Guide for Buenos Aires ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages the power of OpenAI's language models to simulate an intelligent travel assistant focused on **Buenos Aires, Argentina**. The assistant is designed to engage in natural, concise, and informative conversations with users, providing guidance on the city's most iconic landmarks, cultural experiences, culinary highlights, and travel tips for exploring beyond the capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this conversational AI system, users can receive instant answers to questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How far is the Teatro ColÃ³n from the Obelisco?\n",
    "- Where is Plaza de Mayo located?\n",
    "- What are the must-see artworks at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes?\n",
    "- Where can one enjoy authentic tango shows or visit local milongas?\n",
    "- Which parrillas offer the best Argentine steak?\n",
    "- What other cities should travelers visit during their stay in Argentina?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to replicate the experience of speaking with a knowledgeable local tour guide, using AI to generate accurate and context-aware responses. The implementation uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from OpenAI, with a structured prompt history to maintain the flow of conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes all the necessary setup to define the assistant's role, submit multiple tourist-related queries, and display real-time answers returned by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the Python code that initializes the conversation and queries the model for travel guidance:\n"
