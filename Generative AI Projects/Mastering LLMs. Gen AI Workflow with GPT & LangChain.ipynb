This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of generative AI in the context of data analysis and automation. By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage GPT via the OpenAI API and integrate it with LangChain for various tasks.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe dataset we will be exploring is the [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data) from Washington state, USA. This dataset provides detailed information about electric vehicles (EVs) registered in Washington, including make, model, year, and other relevant attributes. It serves as an excellent example to demonstrate how GPT can be used to analyze and derive insights from real-world data.\n\n## Workflow Process\n\n### 1. Setting Up OpenAI Developer Account and Integration with Workspace\n\nThe first step involves setting up an OpenAI developer account. This will allow you to access the OpenAI API, which is essential for interacting with GPT. You will also integrate this API with your workspace to streamline the development process.\n\n### 2. Calling the Chat Functionality in the OpenAI API\n\nOnce the setup is complete, you will learn how to call the chat functionality in the OpenAI API. This will be done in two ways:\n- **Without LangChain:** Directly interacting with the OpenAI API to send prompts and receive responses.\n- **With LangChain:** Utilizing LangChain, a powerful framework that simplifies working with generative AI models, to enhance the interaction with GPT.\n\n### 3. Simple Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is a crucial skill when working with LLMs. You will explore various techniques to craft effective prompts that yield the best possible responses from GPT. This includes understanding the nuances of prompt design and experimenting with different prompt structures.\n\n### 4. Holding a Conversation with GPT\n\nIn this step, you will simulate a conversation with GPT. This will demonstrate the model's ability to maintain context and provide coherent responses over multiple interactions. It is a key feature that showcases the potential of GPT in applications like customer support, virtual assistants, and more.\n\n### 5. Incorporating GPT into Data Analysis or Data Science Workflow\n\nFinally, you will explore ideas for incorporating GPT into a data analysis or data science workflow. This includes:\n- **Data Cleaning:** Using GPT to identify and correct inconsistencies in the dataset.\n- **Data Exploration:** Generating insights and summaries from the data.\n- **Automated Reporting:** Creating automated reports based on the analysis performed by GPT.","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Setup","metadata":{},"id":"a9274661-8d8c-4cc5-901e-5fc497866b89","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"We need to update the `openai` package, and install the `langchain` and `langchain-openai` packages.

analysis revealed a clear upward trend in the registration of electric vehicles over the years. This indicates a growing adoption of electric vehicles, likely driven by increasing environmental awareness and advancements in electric vehicle technology.\n\n2. **Vehicle Type Distribution**: By categorizing the data by electric vehicle type, we observed that certain types of electric vehicles are more popular than others. This insight can help manufacturers and policymakers understand consumer preferences and tailor their strategies accordingly.\n\n3. **Model Year Impact**: The model year analysis showed that newer models tend to have higher registration numbers. This could be due to improvements in technology, better marketing, or incentives for newer models.\n\n### Project Summary\n\nIn this project, we leveraged the capabilities of GPT through the OpenAI API and LangChain to assist in data analysis and visualization. Here are the key steps and skills demonstrated:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: We started by preparing the dataset, ensuring it was clean and structured for analysis. This step is crucial for accurate and meaningful insights.\n\n2. **GPT Assistance**: We used GPT to generate ideas for analyses and to write code snippets. This demonstrated how AI can be a valuable assistant in the data analysis process, helping to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.\n\n3. **Visualization**: Using Plotly Express, we created a bar plot to visualize the total count of electric cars by model year, categorized by electric vehicle type. Visualization is a powerful tool to communicate insights effectively.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**: We discussed the importance of reproducibility in data analysis. By setting the temperature to zero, we ensured that the outputs were consistent, making our workflow more reliable.\n\n### Skills Demonstrated\n\n- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring data quality for accurate analysis.\n- **AI Integration**: Using GPT for generating code and ideas, showcasing the potential of AI in data science.\n- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations to present findings.\n- **Reproducibility**: Implementing practices to ensure consistent and reliable results.\n\nThis project not only provided valuable insights into electric vehicle trends but also demonstrated the effective use of AI tools in enhancing data analysis workflows. By combining human expertise with AI assistance, we can achieve more efficient and insightful analyses.","metadata":{},"id":"ba61448d-2571-4ffa-ac93-47d0eba4c94e","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
