    "# Injury Type Classification and Retrieval with Pinecone and Vector Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Every workplace—whether it's a bustling construction site, a corporate office, or a quiet warehouse—carries some level of risk. When accidents occur, be it a slip, a fall, or a repetitive strain injury, workers’ compensation plays a crucial role. This system ensures injured employees receive the support they need while helping businesses manage claims in a structured and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it’s time for us to step into the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our goal is to analyze workers’ compensation claims and retrieve cases that match specific injury types based on user-defined query prompts. From uncovering patterns in back injuries and falls to detecting repetitive motion strains, our work aims to reveal how injuries occur and how similar claims are addressed. These insights have the power to inform better workplace safety practices and more strategic resource allocation.\n",

    "- Worker-related details  \n",
    "- A natural language description of the accident  \n",

    "To maintain privacy and optimize performance, we've narrowed the dataset to the **first 100 records** of the original file sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This sample allows for meaningful analysis while conserving OpenAI API usage.\n",
