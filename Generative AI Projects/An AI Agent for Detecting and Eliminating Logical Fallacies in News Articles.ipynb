According to IBM's widely cited definition, \"An artificial intelligence (AI) agent refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.\" Agents are designed to handle tasks that are either too complex or too tedious for humans to perform manually, making them invaluable in various applications such as data analysis, customer service, and content moderation.\n\n### Uses of Agents\nAgents can be employed in a multitude of scenarios, including but not limited to:\n- Automating repetitive tasks\n- Analyzing large datasets\n- Providing customer support through chatbots\n- Moderating content to ensure compliance with guidelines\n- Enhancing decision-making processes by providing insights and recommendations\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n### Objective\nIn this project, we aim to develop an agent that can identify and remove logical fallacies from news articles. Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. By eliminating these fallacies, we can improve the quality and reliability of news content.\n\n### Logic and Workflow\nThe agent will follow a structured workflow to achieve its objective:\n1. **Input Data**: The agent will take news articles as input.\n2. **Fallacy Detection**: Using a predefined list of logical fallacies and their descriptions (stored in `fallacies_df`), the agent will scan the articles to identify any instances of these fallacies.\n3. **Fallacy Removal**: Once identified, the agent will either flag or remove the fallacies from the text.\n4. **Output Data**: The cleaned articles, free from logical fallacies, will be provided as output.\n\n### Applicability\nThe logic and workflow used in this project can be easily adapted to create similar agentic tools for other applications, such as:\n- Detecting and correcting grammatical errors\n- Identifying and removing biased language\n- Ensuring compliance with editorial guidelines\n\nBy leveraging the power of AI agents, we can automate complex tasks and enhance the quality of content across various domains.","metadata":{},"id":"d026d32b-262a-4844-bc99-9325c50a33f6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Methodology overview for this high-level agent to check the news for logical fallacies:\n1. Pulls relevent news articles from the Serper API with a user prompt \n\n2. Chain 1: Calls a model to check for pre-defined logical fallacies in a pandas dataframe\n\n3. Chain 2: Calls the model again to output the result in 2 stages of analysis \n\nRemember:\nIt doesn't have to analyze all logical fallacies, or even the complete news articles - the succesful use case here for an agent is designed so that if there is something caught, it is important for the user to be aware of (and verify for accuracy).\n","metadata":{},"id":"caaa0672-05e8-4da6-b330-f3b5414e0fc3","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Setup","metadata":{},"id":"47f83d3f-5dc3-4442-8244-8d37bce3c46c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"1.

Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Increases Section 232 Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum\nURL: https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-increases-section-232-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum/\n\nAnalysis Results:\n1. **Most impactful fallacy:**  \n**False Causality** (Fallacy #5) — The summary implies that increasing tariffs directly protects national security by addressing unfair trade practices and excess global production, suggesting a straightforward cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.\n\n2. **Why this fallacy might mislead readers:**  \nReaders may be led to believe that the tariff increase is the definitive and sole solution to national security threats posed by steel and aluminum imports. This oversimplifies complex economic and security dynamics, potentially obscuring other factors or consequences, such as retaliation, increased costs for consumers, or alternative security measures.\n\n3. **Alternative interpretation of why the fallacy could have been included:**  \nThe summary might have included this causal framing to align with the legal justification under Section 232, which explicitly links imports to national security concerns. This could be an attempt to clarify the rationale behind the policy rather than to mislead, reflecting the official narrative rather than an analytical conclusion.\n"}]},{"source":"## Conclusion\n\nIn this project, we aimed to analyze an article by identifying logical fallacies within its content. The process involved several key steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: We started with a dataframe `fallacies_df` that contains a list of common logical fallacies and their descriptions. This dataframe served as a reference for identifying fallacies in the article.\n\n2. **Article Analysis**: We used two chains to process the article:\n   - **Chain 1**: This chain summarized the article content and identified potential fallacies based on the `fallacies_df`.\n   - **Chain 2**: This chain took the summary from Chain 1 and performed a more detailed analysis, cross-referencing the fallacies identified in the summary with the descriptions in `fallacies_df`.\n\n3. **Result Presentation**: Finally, we printed the title and URL of the article along with the detailed analysis results.\n\n### Insights\n\n- **Fallacy Identification**: The project successfully identified and categorized logical fallacies within the article. This can be particularly useful for critical reading and improving the quality of arguments in writing.\n- **Automation Potential**: The use of chains to automate the summarization and analysis process demonstrates the potential for scalable and efficient content analysis.\n- **Data Utilization**: Leveraging a structured dataframe of fallacies allowed for systematic and consistent identification of logical errors, highlighting the importance of well-organized reference data in analytical tasks.\n\n### Detailed Results\n\nHere are the results we obtained from the analysis:\n\n- **Title**: The title of the article analyzed.\n- **URL**: The URL where the article can be accessed.\n- **Analysis**: A detailed breakdown of the logical fallacies identified within the article, including the type of fallacy and a brief description of each.\n\nThe analysis results provide a comprehensive view of the logical structure of the article, highlighting areas where logical fallacies are present. This detailed feedback can be instrumental in refining arguments and ensuring the integrity of the content.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7b79f629-dcb8-40f3-b7b1-355cd61361cf"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
