This approach addresses a common limitation of traditional language models: their tendency to generate responses that may lack factual accuracy. By integrating external knowledge sources, RAG significantly improves the factual reliability of generated responses.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated question-answering bot capable of addressing movie-related queries with high accuracy. To achieve this, we will employ RAG to supply the language model with pertinent factual information. The workflow involves several key steps, each contributing to the overall functionality and performance of the bot.\n\n### Tools and Models\n\nWe will utilize the following tools and models to build our question-answering system:\n\n- **OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model**: This model will be used for generating prompt completions and answering user queries.\n- **OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model**: This model will create vector embeddings of movie descriptions, enabling efficient similarity searches.\n- **Pinecone**: A vector database that will store the embeddings and facilitate rapid retrieval of relevant information.\n- **Langchain**: A powerful tool that will streamline interactions between OpenAI's models and Pinecone, ensuring seamless integration and operation.\n\n### Dataset\n\nThe dataset for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [IMDb Movies/Shows with Descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/imdb-data-with-descriptions). It contains comprehensive information about various movies, including titles, genres, descriptions, ratings, and more.\n\n### Workflow\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: \n   - Load and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is clean and structured.\n   - Extract relevant columns such as movie titles, descriptions, and other metadata.\n\n2. **Embedding Creation**:\n   - Use the `text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate vector embeddings for each movie description.\n   - Store these embeddings in the Pinecone vector database.\n\n3. **Query Processing**:\n   - When a user submits a movie-related question, convert the query into an embedding using the same embedding model.\n   - Search the Pinecone database for the most relevant movie descriptions based on the query embedding.\n\n4. **Response Generation**:\n   - Provide the retrieved context to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.\n   - Generate a coherent and factual response to the user's query using the context.\n\n5. **Evaluation and Iteration**:\n   - Continuously evaluate the performance of the bot.\n   - Fine-tune the retrieval and generation processes to enhance accuracy and relevance.\n\n### Goals and Scope\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to create a robust and reliable question-answering bot that can handle a wide range of movie-related questions. By integrating RAG, we aim to achieve the following:\n\n- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Provide factually correct answers by leveraging external knowledge sources.\n- **Improved User Experience**: Deliver coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.\n- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle a large volume of queries efficiently.\n\nThis project will serve as a valuable addition to your generative AI portfolio, showcasing your ability to implement advanced techniques and build practical applications using state-of-the-art models and tools.\n\nLet's dive into the implementation and bring this movie question-answering bot to life!\n```","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Setup","metadata":{},"id":"a9274661-8d8c-4cc5-901e-5fc497866b89","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"To perform this analysis, we need to install the following packages:\n\n- `openai`: for interacting with OpenAI.\n- `pinecone-client`: for interacting with Pinecone.\n- `langchain`: a framework for developing with generative AI.\n- `langchain-openai` and `langchain-pinecone`: Langchain extension modules with functionality for OpenAI and Pinecone.\n- `tiktoken`: a string encoder that generates tokens used by OpenAI.

Of course, a cost is associated with this. You can derive the cost from the [pricing page of OpenAI](https://openai.com/pricing).\n\nThe calculation is based on the amount of _tokens_ in the text. All text is encoded into tokens to be used by OpenAI. On average, a token consists of roughly 3 characters.

In this task, we'll need to:\n\n1. Generate vector embeddings for all documents in `docs`. We'll utilize OpenAI for this purpose. langchain provides a convenient helper for this task, `langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings`, which you can use to generate embeddings using the latest `text-embedding-ada-002` model.\n2. Populate the vector index in Pinecone with these embeddings. Fortunately, langchain also offers assistance with this through the [`langchain.vectorstores.Pinecone`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone) helper.\n\nThese two steps can be combined using the convenient helper method `.from_document` of the `Pinecone` class. This method accepts an embedding model as input and efficiently calculates the embeddings, subsequently uploading them to Pinecone. We will also introduce some control flow to the code to ensure we do not add data to the Pinecone index if it already contains data. To achieve this, we can make use of the `.from_existing_index` method of `Pinecone`.\n\nIn addition to storing vectors, Pinecone allows the storage of additional metadata. When using the langchain helpers, it automatically assumes that vectors should be created from the `page_content` property of each `Document`. All other properties will be included as metadata.\n\nYou can verify that everything has worked correctly by accessing the `imdb-movies` index in the Pinecone UI.","metadata":{},"id":"9ea4d375-28be-4deb-a11d-960215c13589","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"- From the `langchain_openai` package, import `OpenAIEmbeddings`.\n- From the `langchain_pinecone` package, import `PineconeVectorStore`.\n- Create the embeddings object.\n- Create an index from its name.","metadata":{},"id":"290c64c4-c5d2-426f-bb71-2d98fdd2d89c","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore\n\n# embeddings object\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\n# we will create an index from its name\nindex = pc.Index(index_name)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":100,"lastExecutedAt":1749421443776,"lastExecutedByKernel":"eca79804-074f-45d1-b3f0-60f027c99b8a","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore\n\n# embeddings object\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\n# we will create an index from its name\nindex = pc.Index(index_name)"},"id":"d31de2ab-bc68-402e-a61b-350de59246f0","cell_type":"code","execution_count":131,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Fill the index. _Some control flow is provided._\n\n- Count the number of vectors in the index.

For instance, when asked \"What's a good movie about vikings?\", the movie 'The Northman' was returned as a result. It is important to note that we did not incorporate any measure of movie quality into the system, so the notion of the movie being \"good\" is not explicitly encoded in the embeddings. It is crucial to always consider the data provided to the system and interpret the results of the AI system within that context. To enhance the results, one approach could be to include information about the movie quality in the movie description.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of RAG is the ability to provide relevant context to the LLM within the prompt itself. In the aforementioned example, we would include a description of 'The Northman' in the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate factual information beyond its knowledge cutoff. 'The Northman' was released in 2022, while the knowledge cutoff for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model is set at September 2021.\n\nNow that you understand how the retriever can be employed to retrieve relevant documents from the vector database, we need to devise a prompt that presents this information to the LLM when we pose a question.\n\nWe require two types of [prompt templates](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/):\n- A template that demonstrates how the information in relevant documents is presented to the LLM\n- A template that combines the context with the rest of the prompt\n\nSome example prompt templates are provided in the sample code below, which you are free to edit.

By enabling debug logging, we were able to gain deep insights into the step-by-step execution of the chains, which is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of our AI workflows.\n\n#### Steps Performed:\n1. **Importing Langchain**: We started by importing the Langchain library, which is essential for creating and managing chains of LLMs.\n2. **Enabling Debug Logging**: By setting `langchain.debug` to `True`, we enabled detailed logging, which helped us trace the flow of data and the execution of each chain and LLM.\n3. **Executing `qa_with_sources`**: We invoked the `qa_with_sources` function to ask questions about movies, leveraging the Langchain framework to fetch and process relevant information.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n- **Chain Execution**: Langchain allows for the seamless execution of multiple LLMs or AI systems in a chain, where the output of one serves as the input for the next. This chaining mechanism is marked with tags like `[chain/start]` and `[chain/end]`, providing clear visibility into the process.\n- **Debugging and Optimization**: The debug logs provided by Langchain are invaluable for debugging and optimizing the chains. They offer detailed information about each step, including the inputs and outputs of each LLM, which helps in identifying bottlenecks and improving performance.\n- **Relevance and Accuracy**: By using embeddings to find relevant documents, Langchain ensures that the information passed through the chains is both relevant and accurate. This is particularly important for tasks like question answering, where the quality of the final response depends on the quality of the intermediate steps.\n\n#### Potential for Industry Applications:\nThe Langchain framework is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of AI projects in the industry. Its ability to manage complex chains of LLMs makes it suitable for tasks such as:\n- **Customer Support**: Automating customer support with accurate and context-aware responses.\n- **Content Generation**: Creating high-quality content by chaining multiple LLMs for brainstorming, drafting, and editing.\n- **Data Analysis**: Performing complex data analysis by chaining models that handle data extraction, transformation, and interpretation.\n\nIn conclusion, Langchain is a powerful tool for managing and executing chains of LLMs, offering detailed logging and optimization capabilities. Its potential applications in the industry are vast, making it a valuable asset for any AI-driven project.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"43d5b169-96eb-44e7-9ece-6aef345803e7"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
