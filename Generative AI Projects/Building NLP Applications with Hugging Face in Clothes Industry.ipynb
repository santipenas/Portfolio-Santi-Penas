Our journey will cover a range of common NLP tasks, including:\n\n- **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizing text as negative, positive, or neutral to understand the sentiment behind user reviews.\n- **Text Embedding**: Transforming text into numerical, n-dimensional vector representations, which are essential for various downstream tasks.\n- **Semantic Search**: Matching a query with the most appropriate result based on embeddings, enabling more intuitive and accurate search functionalities.\n- **And More**: Exploring additional NLP tasks and techniques as we progress.\n\n## Dataset Overview\n\nThe dataset we will be using comes from \"Rent the Runway\" and can be accessed [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~jmcauley/datasets.html#clothing_fit). It comprises user reviews on clothing items, their ratings on fit, and other metadata about the user (e.g., gender, height, size, age, reason for renting) and the item (e.g., category). This dataset offers a rich mixture of data types, with a significant focus on textual data, making it ideal for our NLP experiments.\n\n## Project Workflow\n\n### 1. Data Preprocessing\nWe will start by cleaning and preprocessing the text data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes tasks such as removing special characters, handling missing values, and normalizing text.\n\n### 2. Sentiment Analysis\nUsing Hugging Face's pre-trained models, we will perform sentiment analysis on the user reviews. This will involve categorizing each review as positive, negative, or neutral and assigning a sentiment score.\n\n### 3. Text Embedding\nWe will transform the cleaned text into embeddings using state-of-the-art transformer models. These embeddings will serve as the foundation for various NLP tasks, including semantic search and clustering.\n\n### 4. Semantic Search\nLeveraging the embeddings, we will implement a semantic search functionality that matches user queries with the most relevant reviews. This will demonstrate the power of embeddings in understanding the context and meaning of text.\n\n### 5. Visualization and Analysis\nFinally, we will visualize the results of our analyses, such as sentiment trends over time and the distribution of sentiment scores. This will help us gain deeper insights into the data and the effectiveness of our NLP models.\n\n## Tools and Libraries\n\nThroughout this project, we will be using the following tools and libraries:\n\n- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For accessing pre-trained models and performing various NLP tasks.\n- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.\n- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning tasks and evaluation, particularly the TSNE function.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nMost importantly, we bring our curiosity and enthusiasm for NLP workflows, especially those involving Hugging Face transformers. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Setup","metadata":{},"id":"a9274661-8d8c-4cc5-901e-5fc497866b89","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"For this project, we will need several Python packages:\n\n- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures like DataFrames to handle and analyze structured data efficiently.\n- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.\n- `datetime`: A module that supplies classes for manipulating dates and times, essential for handling time-series data and date-related operations.\n- `re`: The regular expression library in Python, used for string searching, matching, and manipulation, which is crucial for text preprocessing tasks.\n- `string`: A module that provides a collection of string operations and constants, useful for various text processing tasks.\n- `matplotlib.pyplot`: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

formal enough for this casual beach weddingitsbackless though so you cant wear a bra and because the neck is such a scoopneck it makes the neckline a little strange if you have a chest and dont wear onei ended up getting one of those stick on bras and the dress looked much betterits much pinker than the model picture which was a pleasant surprisepretty dress comfortable just a little awkward fitting in the chest area if you have anything larger than an abuy the stick on bra","this dress was greatit fit really well and was very comfortablethe only negative is that the length is a little odd so it made walking up stairs and getting into the car a little difficultimlbs and the medium fit perfectly","super flattering i am usually a sizemi have a dd chest and this dress was so flattering on","thefit better in the chest but it was too loose in the waist but thefit perfectly in the waist","i had some problems with the zipper even on the hanger it was very tricky to zip up i had plenty

but unfortunately i was unable to wear it due to some quality issues which the renttherunway team was excellent at handlingi would recommend going upsizes from your usual dress size if you have a larger bustit also runs on the long side imand even withinch heels it dragged a little too much for my preferencethe colours are rich and true to the picture the fabric is forgiving when it comes to wrinkles so its a dress that travels very well","i wore this dress for an attorney mixer it definitely stood out in a sea of black suits i paired this dress with a classic black blazera belt ","the fit of this dress runs small imlbs and typically wear a sizei ordered aand thewasnt even close to being able to zip up ended up wearing theand it was still snug i would recommend sizing up with this dress cut and color are beautiful and classy fabric is thick and hides your flaws would love to buy this dress","usually the issue for me is that if the top fits the bottom is too small and vice versa but in this instance the bottom fit but i couldnt get the back strip to connect so i had to essentially wear it as a backless dress it worked but was not ideal it was also much longer on me than shown on the model","the sizefit perfectly because i have big arms i normally wear a sizeorbut overall the dress fit perfectly but just a little short because im","this was not flattering on my curvesdidnt leave the wardrobe","fabric is nice and thick and so it is a flattering piece for workthe neckline is too bunched up and awkward to make it a knockout thoughloved the colora nice sort of oxblood ","this dress is beautiful elegantromantic wa touch of sexy i highly recommend it i wore the mr wheels that wereinchesi am tall so the dress came off the ground about an inch more that i would have liked other than that it was the perfect dress for a perfect evening ","loved this dressgorgeous color and so fashionable runs a little large so i would go down a size next time but i would definitely rent it again ","the dress arrived with a small hole in the beading on the front but wasnt too noticeable glad i was able to get two sizes because thewas a little tight and wouldve made for an uncomfortable night of dancing ","the dress does run small as do other ml dresses but was a great fit once i was in the correct size it was a great dress if you plan on dancing because there is a lot

received great feedback and felt wonderful in the dress ","i loved this dress it is so beautiful yet very functional pockets this dress runs a bit small but oddly only in the arms i have very small

longer hem in the back made me feel justified wearing it to a church ceremony ","the color is really pretty in person and definitely stands out in a crowd ","i rented this dress for a winter white themed cocktail party and could not have been happier this dress fits true to size im between aand anand due to the neckline and sleeves went with theto fit my broad shoulders the dress is lined so no

a small ","dress fit true to sizei loved the design just wished the ruffles and pleats were higherthe extra fabric hung by my hips and butti got several compliments and i was very comfortable all night","rented this for a fundraising gala loved the thicker fabric felt warm in february imand the dress came just to my knees the color is more of a berryreally rich and the back is gorgeous i didnt wear a bra with it just petals and it worked well other reviews say its a stretchy dresstheres a bit of give but with the satin liner i wouldnt say its a stretchy dress its got a very slim fit that hugs your curvesthe medium was spot on for me the black liner does sometimes show from the bottom of the dress ","the dress is super cute and comfortable loved the pattern wore to welcome dinner drinks event for the night before a wedding the fabric is heavier so if you are going to be out in the heat for a long period of time you will definitely be sweating my only comment is that the dress looked a little worn was pilling in multiple places making it look worn ","it is a great dress and it made me feel greatit is fitted and white so you have to wear the correct underwear so it does not show through the dress wear it with neutral color panties and bra and that should do the trickit is simple but it makes a great statementit is a beautiful dress","i loved this dress and felt beautiful in it the only problem was that it looked a little worn out ","perfect for clubbing in vegasi wore thebut thefit as well wear with a nubra or no bra at all ","i amand the dress hit me right at the knee the dress looks much shorter on the model in the photo so it really depends on your height the fit was perfect and i didnt even have to try on the second size option this dress is a little on the heavy side so i would not recommend it for a summer wedding the wedding i went to was in the fall so it was perfect to keep me a little warmer","this fits true to size i am very petite on the top and have a butt so this was a flattering fit i could not wear a bra with this but that was not a problem for me the color was divinea vibrant lilac and it was a huge hit at the party it has small cutouts on the front waistline and a very open back with a unique back detailthat i loved the bottom as fitted at the hip and loose but tailored to the knee ","i rented this dress for a wedding this septemberi cannot tell you how many compliments i got on this dressi would have normally rented the regular size but it was sold out so i went for the longthe long was completely fine with the inch heels i worelike all the other reviews here i would say that fashion tape is your friend with this babyno need to wear a bra but i did use the fashion tape to make sure i wasnt falling out of it or flashing anyonecould not recommend this dress anymore along with the overall rtr processthis was my first time using the site and it was so wonderfully easy and fun go for it ladies","i thought that the dress fit wonderfully however a little tight in the bust the small my normal size fit best in the bust however seemed to be a big loose everywhere else great dress for the party received many compliments on it","i ordered it but didnt wear it imand it was a little too short but it was a pretty dress ","this dress is adorable it fits tight enough on the top to be cute and flares out in a way that is very flattering for an hourglass shape i found the neckline to be the perfect v neck depth as well my only complaint is that this dress is very thick i thought id be able to wear it in to spring with unlimited but i think its too warm for that would rent again","fits true to size perfect length and just the right tightness material is thicker so it was perfect for the early spring type of weather ","the waist fit a little loose but with the ruching it was not noticeable and very comfortable","great dress"," i loved the side slit and the black and white was eye catching i worn in vegas for a night out it was a little big on mylbs frame but it wasnt too badthe slit was sexy its a midi length on shorties like me but i was okay with that much shorter and that slit would have been unseemly","this hugged in all the right places it was a perfect dress for my event and i received so many compliments on it not to mention customer service was great getting this to me in less thanhours","i rented both the xs and sm both fit almost identical i ended up wearing the xs because the hem on the sm was just not laying righti paired this dress with all rose gold accessories and received complements on how beautiful my dress wasthis dress was so comfortable elegant and did not make me hot at all with all the dancing i did","the dress was true to size but a little fitted around the hip area i went with the one size smaller because it accentuated the waistline better the fabric is gorgeous and the color is striking in person a must have for a wedding or similar event fabulous weddingflorals ","i wore this dress after my wedding reception to go down to the bars im usually aorbut ordered theandbased on other reviews i ended up wearing theimand the dress was midthigh so definitely on the short side its comfortable but pretty tight ie isnt very forgiving and shows every lump and bump overall it was a great choicecomfy cheap and looked super cute with cowboy boots","beautiful dressreceived multiple complimentsphotographs beautifullyruns long imand woreinch heels and i had to pick up my dress to walk all nightgranted as it drapes beautifully it looked nice even as i carried iti found it slipped on me and i spent a lot of time pulling up the dress","the fit is very goodthe sleeve openings are a little low so i had to be careful in photo poses not to show too much weird armpit areai was also surprised how heavy it but that makes the flow of the dress spectacular","i wore a low back strapless bustier under the dressi kept the jewelry simple wearing only earringsyouhave to take short steps as the dress is narrow and comes down below the knee","the dress is beautiful sexy and perfect for a black tie affairi had countless compliments all night i loved it so much i rented it twice in a few monthsi usually wear a sizebut i decided to have a more fitted look so i wore a sizeand it hugged every curve beautifullythefit well as well but i wanted a more fitted sexy look so i went with the smaller sizei wore a small waist corset underneath for some added curve and to smooth out my stomach","wore this to my baby shower and received many compliments i did end up wearing a nude tank top underneath as pregnancy made my chest bigger than normal and as a non chesty prepregnant lady the amount of cleavage made me uncomfortable however this seems to be highly personal as all of my friends insisted i didnt need one as a sizing note when i wore this dress i was a large d maybe a bit bigger and about lbs","i got a lot of complimentsthis is stunning onthe sleeves and the hemline are fun and flirty yet classy","i was not expecting too much from this dress but was pleasantly surprisedi probably could have worn the xs but the s seemed better suited for a family weddingthe lace was very soft and stretchyvery comfortable to wear but still flattering on the waist and hipsthe neckline is cut low enough to give some appeal but definitely not over the topthe bra strap snaps were an added bonus so i could wear a regular bra without worrying about the straps slipping downi received a number of complimentswould definitely recommend","fits very snug but cute and still modest","received this dress in my back up size of w because the dress i originally ordered adriana papel sip and see sheath was not available even tho my original dress fit in the sizei went with this one because i loved it so much it was a bit largedefinitely could have gone with thein this modelbut as part of the wedding i attended required us to sit on the floor i decided the larger size might be a bit more comfortable anyway it also ran a bit long on me but thats typical as im onlyi got tons of compliments on how flattering the color was i would definitely recommend this im already considering ordering it in a size down for a future event ","the buttons are the worst on this dressmake sure you have someone to help you get dressed because you will not be able to put it on aloneonce it is on the dress fits amazinglyi was hesitant on wearing this dress at first because i thought it was too plain but all night i received compliments on how great the dress looked","i didnt end up wearing this dress it was super cute but did not fit me the right waysi felt like it might have been a bit inappropriate for the wedding i rented it for the v in the front was low enough that with a bra i had great cleavage not grandparentappropriate but without a bra the dress was too big on the top maybe for a different kind of formal event where there are less family members also the color is really bright if i rent this dress again id probably try out the blue","this dress is gorgeous i wore it to a formal southern wedding and got a ton of compliments very ladylike you should know that the fabric has texture and a beautiful sheen to it keep in mind that there is no stretch so you might want to size up for dancing purposes fit like a glove ","great for curves without too much cleavage and not too short so completely sexy while leaving a reasonable amount to the imagination such a great dress so many compliments and neck snaps ","the dress was a great weight and quality so it hung well and was very flattering on my generally curvy body it is long so i needed to wear pretty high heels imbut it wasnt impossible i would recommend for a classic flattering look ","classy comfy gorgeous and fun to twirl around dance inyou cant tell from the photos but the dress is connected with nude mesh at the midsectionimand the xsr was the perfect length withinch heels","this dress was the real star of the partybeautiful silhouette color and shinei usually wear sizes but this dress is running a bit small i wasnt able to zip it up completely so i had to resort to my backup dress which ran in m overall it fit great however the deep plunge was a bit tricky since i dont have a full bust wearing a regular bra didnt seem like the best idea but a silicon bust enhancer helped what is really great about this dress is that it was successfully able to cover my apple tummy im a skinny apple though so most of the clothes can do that no spanx needed ","i think this has been my favorite dress from rtr so fari love shoshanna and this dress was perfect for work but could easily have been worn out to drinks afterlace details was beautiful and the fit was great","dress runs small and is tight in the rib cage area the wide skirt is very flattering the pockets are awesome and very deep you can put a phone notes lipstick etc and no one will notice the boatneck is very flattering as well received many compliments the element i disliked was the back zipper it was obviously replaced and not as nice of quality compared to the back up size dress not a deal breaker though ","great dress only downside was the zipper it was also a little warm for the evening out in the summer","i am typically aandwas perfectwould have been too big i would either get your normal size or one size down ","i thought this dress was tailored for meive never had a dress fit so wellit was heavier than i expected but was very comfortablei danced all night long with no problem","i had originally ordered another badgley mischka dress and it ended up not fitting properly but thanks to rtrs fantastic customer service they had this dress to me by noon the next daythis is such a fun flattering dress and i didnt want to take it offthe color is even more outstanding in person compliments all night longi wore the long with approxin heels and it still reached the floorpaired it with the ella carter ashley necklace and it looked wonderful","i rented this dress for my mom she loved it she ordered aand athewas very tight on her but thewas too large in the bust area her only complaint was that the fabric did not have much give to it however it was a big hit at the wedding and everyone loved it the dress is a bit on the long side so unless youre a younger person going for a more conservative look i would suggest leaving this for the more mature fashionistas ","this dress was absolutely beautiful on the hanger and on me unfortunately it was a little bit small im hopeful to rent again in a size or two bigger ","this dress runs large size down size down size down typically ain dresses but always worried about length i felt comfortable ordering this as a bridesmaids dress in which i knew i would be wearinginch heels this puts me overfeet this dress was the perfect length with the heels without it was a mess and too long which is a luxury that i never have thewould have worked but thefit like a glove and i knew i could move comfortably without worrying about dancing and the bridal party photos my dress needed a really good steaming after i received it before i could wear it ","the color on this dress is absolutely beautiful in addition the fabric is a lot thicker than anticipated which made it look lovely on the hanger the straps are too long which made the top sit funny in addition while it fit true to size it didnt look nice on i ordered this through unlimited so had the luxury of putting in the bag and picking something else","great lbd loved all my photos in itstars because i wish it was a little tighter in the bust the straps fell to the sides on me a few times i am not small chested but also not big i am a b c therefore i should be the perfect fit for it i went braless fabric is thick enough to hide everything for the most part there is no stretch in the dress so this could be a little risky","it had a really loose fit that was comfortable but the midsection bunches around the waist giving you a heftier silhouette than ideal otherwise under a leather jacket and over slim jeans it was the perfect dress tunic to run around in had a beautiful ethereal quality to it but not so precious that you cant do everything you need to do to get through the day i wore it to work then to the car shop grocery store and then to a playdate with my girls it surprisingly survived everything fabric doesnt snag and given all the intricate detailsthis was impressive\n","the dress was a little loose\nnormally waer aand thewas still a little big","the fit was impeccable i ordered a r and r and thefit which made my day obviously hard to find shoes that matched its glamour honestly but thats the only con ","probably could have gone a size up the dress is really tight in the bust area tookpeople to zip it ","i ordered abut probably should have worn ai wore spanks and it didnt seem to helpi looked pregnant in a few photos because it was rather tight in my midsectionthis dress shows way more cleavage than the pictures indicateit was a bit much for a family weddingthe dress was beautifully detailed","loved this dress i wore it to an outdoor wedding in august it was absolutely perfect for the occasion and i received so many compliments the material is thicker but i wasnt too hot in the dress it is such a fun cute dress and i felt so stylish in it i might have to rent this one again i loved it so much","i ended up wearing a different option from rent the runway since this dress was a little too formal for the wedding i was attendinghowever i absolutely loved this dressit is elegant and uniqueit is form fitting but the best part is that the material has a little stretch so it conforms to your body for an exact fitthe material is high quality and the beading detail is intricatei highly recommend this dress for a black tie event","the dress fellinches above my kneethe material was thick but very comfortable the dress was a bit baggy on my petite framebut worked well enoughi saw a girl with more curves wearing the dress and i thought it looked better on heri wore it to work with a cardigan and black tights and received many complimentsit transitioned well to an evening cocktail party","i amand i wanted the l based on reviews but it was already rented i went with the l for the ceremony and felt kind of blahthe dress was too big and didnt compliment my figure at all i switched to the r for the reception and am so happy i did it was formfitting but still incredibly tasteful and flattering i woreinch heels and was overall happy with the length i do think the l would have been the perfect size forand above id recommending having a backup in r or l whatever you dont select initially if youre close to this height as it could go either way ","i amand did not wear heels and the dress fell perfectly to the ground with the r if i had worn heels i wouldve needed to go with the l the fit around my waist was perfect and this dress was extremely flattering and comfortable i would definitely encourage wearing a necklace with this dress as it looked too plain without one the fabric was beautiful and felt light but expensive i gave this dress four stars instead of five because there was a stain at the bottom of it overall i was very happy with the dress it was modest but very beautiful the cut around the shoulders flattered my arms and my waist looked tiny i could move in it and felt comfortable sitting and standing and did not have to wear a bra it was the perfect dress for this occasion","i rented this as a back up dress for a weddingi ended up wearing the other dress and chose to wear this while out and about in san antonio the next dayi loved this dressit is true to size the right length great quality and it gave me the appearance of having cleavagei imagine the top would run small for those with larger bustsoverall an awesome dressi would rent this again in a heartbeat","great fit ","if you have the slightest bit of back fat and you don’t want it to show go up a size the dress is not forgiving back there it’s also snug in the arms but it was a great fit in the bust and butt i am a slim but curvy woman and the dress highlighted that very well the color is perfect and the material is definitely high quality it’s a good piece that i would rent again","comfortable and so cute that it transitions perfectly from day to an evening of pub crawling in new orleans","the dress fit great overallit was a little loose in the chest but you couldnt tell it was a great length for tall heights it hit me about mid calf i would highly recommend for any shape","i ordered the sizewith the sizeas a backupthe sizehad all broken clasps so i couldnt wear it even though that is the size that fitthe sizefit ok but was frumpythe bottom of the dress is a tad big and long for awomani am a d cup and the lace up top was still a little loose on methe dress was beautiful though and i received lots of compliments perfect for a conservative wedding","good if you want to show off you arms and shoulders","runs large too loose i have a large bustdd and it was still loose beautiful dress kind of vintage feel berry color very comfortable ","the dresses arrived just as stated i was impressed by the shipping bag that they arrived

the chest im a dd and didnt have a problemwould love to own this dress ","not flattering on my frame ","i actually got two uses out of this dress in one weekend which i was super happy about it was stunning and i received so many compliments the r fit perfectly as expected my only cons are it was difficult to get on and you definitely need someone to help you tie the back there was also sharp wiring around that kept poking me in my waist but i put a bandaid where the wiring was and it seemed to solve the problem i recommend this beautiful dress","i loved this dress while i usually wear ai wore thein this because the illusion sleeves are somewhat tight on the arms shoulders and i wanted the freedom to dance it was extremely comfortable i barely had to adjust it all night it was light but well made voluminous but not puffy elegant but also fun it was a great length for me but with low shoes it might be a tripping hazard the pattern appears more greyblackpurple in person i would wear it again in every color if i could ","i loved this dress but it didnt fit me quite rightits a beautiful fabric and colori am usually a o orandand ci ordered thebased on other commentsthe length and hips were great but the waist was very snug fit but uncomfortable while sitting and the bodice was a little loose","this dress was perfect i had wanted something i would be conformable in to go

does run a little on the larger size i have been in a sizepost baby and i rented aafter reading the reviews and it fit perfect for me but i dont think you are supposed to really tighten the strings on it i think the dress is meant to be a little lose i would totally rent this again","this dress was surprisingly low cut the lace sleeves and length are all really sweet and feminine but the lowcut front makes it decidedly sexytoo sexy for some occasions i wore this for an anniversary dinner with my husband and he commented on my visible cleavage and obviously liked that but it made me a little uncomfortable while out since im not used to showing that much i would not have worn this around family or colleagues the straps are long and that makes the front even lower if id owned the dress i could have shortened the strap and it would have been more tasteful but obviously thats not possible with a rental a bit of the lining on one side of the bust kept rolling over and showing slightly over the edge which wasnt a big deal but it wasnt perfect the dress definitely runs a size small i normally wear aand ordered anbased on reviews i wouldnt have fit in my normal size but thewas great the dress is wellmade and the fabric is lovely i would recommend if youre ok with showing off some cleavage","this dress worked out perfecti wore about heels and i felt that the length was just

fyithat said i would definitely rent from rtr again","awesome dress and very flatteringlots of complimentsi will rent again ","i loved this dress the fit was stretchy and flattering and felt extremely comfortable all night it was a little different than anything else ive ever worn as i dont usually wear bold prints but i wound up loving it i was worried about it being too hot on the dance floor but it was actually great to dance in as it didnt move very muchwould rent again ","dress is slightly stretchy so its comfortable it hugs your curves well and the lace looks beautiful i got many compliments on the dress the chest is a bit tight so i did not need to wear a bra and not sure there is room for a bra anyway it is the perfect dress for a cocktail party in the fall it looks great with black heels and some black tights this is the second time i have rented it and would rent it again ","i ended up wearing the medium although it was rather large the small my backup size was just too short so i had to go with the medium to feel more comfortable pretty color but not that flattering on the shape ","the color was beautiful and the dress was very comfortable it was nice and thick for a cold office it was pretty tight in the arms and bust so consider a size up great for spring and summer if you are indoors with ac all day but want to get into the season with some color","the dress has the perfect fit","i wore this to a company holiday event and wanted something that would stand outi loved that it had long sleeves making it feel modern but also more ideal for a company event given that it did run short on me being talli got several compliments on the dressit fit well and the jersey material made it comfortable and stay in place ","fit very snugly and i probably could have used a size up but it wasnt available i made it work with some spanx had a tendency to ride up a bit overall the dress is very comfortable "," i am on the curvier side through the hips and buttthis dress had plenty of give to accommodate thatwould definitely recommend and would definitely rent again","i dont know that i loved it but it was a decent dress for a fall wedding i had to size up due to the tight sleeves but other than that it was fairly flattering im a bit twisty in the photo so its hard to tell","the dress was form fitting but skimmed over the stomach and provided an hourglass shapevery comfortable and fun","i loved wearing this dressi took a risk because there werent any reviews yet but i was drawn to the style and colors and couldnt help myselfi also took a risk with the hemline as i pretty much subscribe to the no hemlines above the knee overrulei was concerned it would be inappropriate for a family weddinghowever it looked so good i forgot all about the hemlinei received many compliments and would definitely rent this one againi amandlbsthefit like a glove and stretched out just the right amount over the evening that it wasnt tight in the waistit also hid my little belly\n","this dress was suggested to me by rtr after my st choice dress was not available i wore this dress to a daytime party with low heel sandalsi also experimented with a dressier look with a rattan belt and wedge heels but decided on a more casual lookthe tangerine color is unique and the silk is beautifuldress was in likenew conditioni would rent this dress again ","it was a little short but so comfortable i wore it to a friends wedding and got so many compliments i would definitely rent this again ","i wanted to like this so much but on a short curvy girl it just did not work the large was a little too big but i dont think sizing down would have helped the straps are long and not adjustable and the busttriangles were small yet also stuck out on the sides its definitely a sexy dress and it would look fabulous on taller women who dont have a lot of curves ","i wore this dress for my birthday dinner at an upscale french quarter restaurant and it was a show stopper i received compliments all night and the blue is very vibrant it looked great against my brown skin a few sizing tips i am usually a sizebut the dress sleeves are unforgiving and if you have breasts larger than an a or b cup the top will be rather tight i wore the sizefor comfort although thevisibly had more wear and the hem had been redone not perfectly overall i loved the dress so i overlooked the flaws in the sizeand had a wonderful birthday dinner","this fit really nicely and was very flatering however the look is a bit more unique than it seems in the picture maybe in a bad way it is a thick sort of suiting material which is very forgiving but makes it a more costumey piece than you might be thinking i was imagining thinner fabric","fit great and was comfortable i got a ton of compliments ","the lining was less than comfortable especially on a hot summer night it became very clingy and did not breathe at all the straps were a little long too i readjusted them frequently especially while seated on the positive site the lace pattern was gorgeous as well the neckline was perfect sexy yet not too revealing overall though i wouldnt rent again just because of the liner and the straps ","the color really popped and the ribbon in the back was a cute touchit was a little warm for a party in july in florida outdoors but it was a beautiful dress and i loved wearing it there is no stretch to it so the sleeves have no give nor does the dress so i would recommend gettingsizes","i received this dress as a backup after my original backup was made unavailable the customer service team with rtr is phenomenal and it was super easy to get a new dress at the last minute this fabric has a cute pattern and the pockets were a huge incentive however the texture of the fabric was thicker than i expected making the straps somewhat uncomfortable and sitting on the cool black mesh bit at the bottom for a three hour dinner was less than ideal overall it was a cute dress but i dont think id rent it again","the cutout was the perfect subtle detail gorgeous fit and fabric hit a bit lower than expected a few inches below the knee but it was super flatteringcould have worn anbut went with a safe","i adore this dress so much that i tried to find it to buy or rent again the yellow color is gorgeous especially with a nice summer tan i wore thebut in hindsight should have worn theboth fit but i think thewould have been little more flattering the lining is short than the lace overlay but since its skin toned you dont notice got lots of complimentswish i could keep it ","this dress is absolutely gorgeous and so comfortable to wearthe only negative is that it wrinkles incredibly easily which was a bit of a bummer during my engagement shoot also i wouldnt recommend this dress for anyone who needs the support of a bra ","fit tight around my rib cage","i rented this for worki wanted a transitional piece that would work for the cold mornings but also something i wouldnt be dying in duringthe afternoon when it warmed upthis dress was perfect the material was light but the coverage of the dress balanced it outthe fit was super flattering i felt so thini got compliments on it all day long i wish i kept it longer ","i am typically a truei ordered theand aas a backup i ended up wearing theas thewas a little tight in the chest the sequins are prettier in person as they have a pattern and arent just randomly placed on the top of the dress the fabric of the skirt is beautiful it poufs more than i expected but its still very pretty and it has pockets i received so many compliments on my dress the only downside was my underarms got scratched a little from the sequins it wasnt unbearable but it did happen","this dress is extremely flattering and comfortable i love the unique design and how simple it is this runs true to size and we recommend sizing up for your backup this is great for any cup size and the fabric is stretchy this should be worn with a strapless bra pair this with a gold cuff or bracelet ","my backup size for the original dress that i choose was not available so they sent me this dress as a backupif i didnt love the first dress so much this would have been a beautiful alternativeit fit so well and hid my stomach which is post babyi will definitely be renting this dress in the future if i have somewhere dressy to go","absolutely loved the cut and fit of this dress every client i encountered that day complimented me on this dress i typically am in between a sizebut this sizewas extremely comfortable a must try","this dress was amazing and i got compliments all night i love the flattering neckline with justenough cleavage and the length was perfect i wore glossy nude pumps and added some glitzy cocktail jewelry to dress it up and pockets to top it all off love i was comfortable the entire evening and wore a normal bra i am going to be so tempted to rent this beauty again","so comfortable but i probably did not need the long and i amno zippers it just hugs every wherei got a zillion complimentsit a head turner","dress was fitted nicely at the waist but definitely made for someone taller and with a longer frame it hit at the middle of the shin and the shoulder part of the material actually stood up aboutinch higher than my actual shoulders the material feels great but just isnt the right fit for petite people","im one of those women that think everyone will look great on them and then i get it home and gowow thats a lot of sequinsthats exactly what happened hereit was beautiful in the bag all golden and glittery but when i put it on it was just too much for methe fabric at the shoulder is a little bunchy and i thought the combination of the bunchy fabric the sequins and the color just made me look broadalso the sequins were a little chafey in the upper armsi just wasnt crazy about how it looked when i was wearing iti had full makeup and hair done and i still didnt feel pretty in it and thats the whole point rightsent it back without wearing it out","loved it the stylist at the vegas store picked it out i didnt think i would like it but it fit perfectly loved the mesh areas made it more unique","very beautiful dress but watch out if you have full hipsunder the sheer overlay there is a tight fitting dress that does not have any stretchalso although the description says it can be worn with any normal bra i dont agreebecause the material was so sheer on top only a strapless bra would really the best","i ordered the rr thefit but thelookedflowed over the body better its quite low cut so if youre not comfortable with the girls showing out you may not want to rent this dress i just sewed in a little stitch to keep it from being too revealing the dress was long on mewithheels but i just picked up the dress as i walked i got compliments all night on the dress and i felt like a movie star definitely would rent again","dress fit slightly snugits a fitted dress around the hipsit was a beautiful dress and my mom received tons of complimentsshe got both aandbut thegaped too much around the bust","i couldnt wear a bra based on the cut of the straps so i didnt have the support and felt a little flat i did get lots of compliments though","this one shouldered black gown is so beautiful and versatilerunning true to size i would suggest sizing up for backup in this stylethe fabric is pretty heavy and does not allow for much stretch and for that reason i would say this style works best for a to c bust sizeswith the one shoulder look on this gown i would suggest going with a strapless brathe natural waist is definitely very fitted but it did allow comfortable room throughout the midsectioni would suggest sizing up for fuller hips as that area is definitely quite fittedthe one shoulder sleeve was definitely a bit tight on my broader shoulders so thats definitely something to keep in mindatthis hit right at the bottom of the floor without heels so i would definitely suggest a long length for women my height or tallerthis dress is perfect for a black tie wedding or gala and i would pair it with a beautiful pair of long earrings a shiny clutch and strappy heels","it fit perfect the material is stretchy and really flattering the boning in the dress helps give a nice shape i didnt need any special undergarments i just wore it as is i was able to dance and i felt really comfortable and classy in this dress ","i rented this and another dress for a ballroom dance weekend at a nice resort hotel i wore this one on the more formal of the two evenings as the lace lent a nice elegance to the dress although it was a shorter dress it worked for the formal night and allowed me to dance without stepping all over a long gown my only complaint was that the torso which was quite fitted creeped up repeatedly as i danced being that my arms were raised to shoulder height assuming most people wouldnt be in a dance frame all night this wouldnt be an issue i have a larger chest ribcage and thefit very well not too snug at all in thethe sleeves were too tight for my arms as it is lace not really any give and they come to the elbow the dress was otherwise quite comfortable and breathed quite well for being fully lined and the pockets are always a bonus for me in a dress","hey you stop looking youve found the dress youre looking for this is tops quality matches priceabout me i amandlbs i have an athletic body longer torso shorter legsre fit stretch because there is no stretch it this at all this fits true to size so if you are agirl like me order thewhereas if youre agirl and youve been watching those sweets for a couple weeks then youll be able to wear thei ordered bothi was worried i wouldnt be able to sit in this but i was able to sit just fine in both theandi was worried that the sleeves wouldnt fit my arms i do back bi and chest tri every week yet the sleeves were fit perfectlyre length sexiness i felt that the dress was appropriately long by todays trends most gals would say its way too long and in fact it would probably be too long for a petite woman however for my bridal shower it really made a lovely statement by being sexy with its illusion top and glittery burnt rose gold without being too sexy appropriate length covered chestfrom the pictures you can tell that i am very very very pale the illusion netting was a different color from my skin but i didnt mind one bit if thats a concern of yours you can always wear panty hose to matchre accessories i wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring my shoes were plain nude peeptoe pumps\n","for people who have a curvier body i wouldnt recommend this dress it will make you look like a sausage it is very tight to fit into but if you have a slimmer more athletic body wear this trust me very complementing to certain areas","great dressi wore this as a bridesmaid in my sisters june texas wedding and got a ton of complimentsi wore a nubra with itthough i probably didnt need toand used fashion tape to keep the shoulders in placei would definitely recommend this dress to anyone considering it","this dress looked amazing on the website and didn’t disappoint in personit made me feel sexy and elegant hugging my curves in just the right waythe back of the dress is spectacular and i could even wear a regular bra with it which is always a bonusthings to bear in mind keep a good posture shoulders back to ensure the gold part at the top doesn’t look buckled in the front youll want to keep it laying flat against your chest for good photosothers had mentioned that the arm holes were a little tight and i agree i had a little redness by the end of the night where they had rubbed against my skin but it was totally worth putting up with for the glamour of the dressthe zipper was very stiff and i doubt i could have zipped it all the way up without assistancei am ’” and could not have worn heels with theregular so i recommend renting the long if you are of a similar height and you like to wear heelsdespite these minor issues i can honestly say this is my most successful rental to datei’ve rented many dresses from rent the runway over the years but this one resulted in so many compliments i lost countthanks for making my night unforgettable","took advantage of my pro free birthday dress since it was on the same night as a friends wedding rehearsal dinner ive rented the orange version of the dress so i was comfortable knowing the sizing was a relaxed fit and true to size love that you can wear a normal bra with it take advantage of the snaps to keep your straps in place and the color is wonderful for spring pair with some strappy nude heels and youre good to go such an easy fun pick that i would recommend for most body types my only critique is that it came with a small black mark on the bottom that didnt really come out when i tried to scrub it with water on my own it was really a speck so it wasnt a deal breaker but a slight blemish on an otherwise perfect dress","i wore this dress to a winter wedding in ca i received so many compliments the color is so vibrant so i wore simple drop earrings and it was perfect im ft in and wore aboutinch heels and the length for the long was perfect it would have been too short had i not gotten the long i usually wear abut ended up wearing the lit stretches but thewas too tight i wish i could have kept this dressim obsessed","this was a backup for a dress that wasnt ready in time i have rented it before and love the dress classy but also sultry wore the size small","i wore this dress for a june outdoor wedding and it was perfect its a very flattering dress and a fun one to accessorize i paired it with a silver skinny belt

recommend this dress","this dress fit perfectly im usually a sizeand it fit very well","i had worn another dress by the same designer to another wedding and wore thebut wore thein this dresscould have gotten away with thebut felt more comfortable in this onethe fabric is think and snug so it was flattering in all the right placesi wore a strapless bra so i could wear it off the shoulder theres no zipper so it does take some effort getting it on and off but once its on you wont want to take it off ","the length was perfect it all fit very true to size","i was so pleasantly surprised that this dress worked i rented it in aand got aas a backup because of other reviewers comments about it running small for me it definitely ran big in the chest and shoulder area which rarely happens im a d i wish i had rented afor a backup although thedefinitely worked and encouraged me to sit up straight all night the big negative of the dress is that the lining is too long and shows when you sit down all in all its classy and sexya perfect summer party combo","i was not able to wear it because the size which fit had ainch opening in the leg seamthe previous wearer had clearly pulled a threadbut it was not fixed before it was sent to me i had to scramble to find a dress the day of the event i was seriously disappointed the stylist who responded to me was prompt and professional she said id receive a full refund when they receive everything back it was a truly beautiful dressbummed i couldnt wear it but i did wear the jewelry i picked ","very pretty dressruns pretty true to size i havent gotten back to my profile stats post babyruns kinda long i amand wore likeheels and maybe should have gone petitealso i did not realize low back when i booked it so had to get some last minute undergarment fix but the low back ended up being fun","imlbs so the r wound up best and worked for methe fit was tighter than i thought it would beit hugs you around the waist hip area but i could still move and dance around itthe only real con was that my size came with some holes damage prior which i hadnt noticed until a day before my event barn weddingso wound up wearing that one anyways and hoped for the beststill after the event i let rent the runways staff know about the damage and fortunately they were super helpful and even refunded me a portion of the costsoverall still a beautiful dress that i believe is one of those dresses that is flattering on most","i wore this for a black tie winter wedding in vailco ieveryone complimented me on this dress all night it was so

underlying dress flutters beautifully in the breezeplus the overall look was surprisingly flattering considering the cut and shape","normally a sizewore aand loved every second of it workheels because the dress truly is that long and if you plan to dance youre going to want to not be tripping over your hem i wore a nude bra and while it could sort of be seen through the panelling on the back of this dress it was complete unnoticeable this dress is super forgiving super moistureabsorbent and super super awesome","i wore this on easteri was a little nervous about wearing all silk since its typically not a forgiving fabric but i thought it fit really wellthe neckline was interesting and trendyi love floral prints so i really liked this dress great for spring","this dress is well made and the fit is quite flattering however i did not end up wearing this dress to my event this dress consists of two layers and i felt that the top layer material was too matronly even for my age imthe only description that comes to mind is stiff doilies from grandmas living room i wanted to love it but just didnt ","ml dresses just fit my body perfectly im smaller in the bustb cup with a bit of a tummy this dress offered enough support to go braless and i rarely feel comfortable enough to do this and forgive my problem areas the color is vibrant and the open back detail is stunning ","imand a busty so i ended up wearing my back up size r unfortunately it was a little too long even withheels so if youre short i would recommend ordering a petite other than that the dress fit beautifully and i would definitely use rent the runway again","great fit and a very comfortable dress i got a lot of compliments","pros fits great super comfortable and i didnt have have to wear a bra\ncons you really roll you dice with the quality of this dress i ordered both theandand i thought thefit better but the color was not blue it was disgusting and honestly a year later and im still unsure why rtr would even think sending this dress to me was acceptable the lace on the top part of both dresses were ripped you could stick you fingers through the holes that bad i was able to stitch up the s holes enough and no one noticed ","in my opinion the pictures dont do this dress justice the deep v is really flattering without being too much for an event like a wedding the material was nice and heavy and the dress was very flattering so no spanx necessary the dress does run quite large im usually always aand i wore theand thought that was even a little roomy i wore this to a wedding and got so many compliments on it ","i loved the vibrant colors and the thick fabric with stretchit was short though esp if you have any bum or thighsthe bust is flattering for smaller chested gals it shows your tummy so keep that in mind it felt fun and flirty on and my husband thought i looked hot","the dress was just a beautiful in person as it was in the pictuream so glad it worked for me","i rented this as a back up dress for nye but ended up wearing a different dress i didnt like this dress for two reasonsthe back is completely different than what is picturedits just an opaque mesh back with a zippernot the buttons open back pictured and its also much longer my friend ended up wearing the dress and she is very tallapproxand it was almost knee length on her we ended up folding the dress under so it would be a littleinches shorter otherwise it was a nice dress and the fit was goodits just a lot more conservative than the photo shown ","i usually wear a four and this dress in a sizefit perfectly the red is darker in person than in the picture it is more like a maroon or a dark wine color which i honestly liked better highly recommend this dress comfortable dancing felt pretty received tons of compliments ","wore this to a baby shower and a baptism and got lots of complimentslength was perfect and overall the fit was greatthe only issue was that the armholes were a bit big so you could see a tiny but of my bra as things shifted around","i got a sizeas a backup but never even tried it on thefit perfectly the dress is indeed long and i agree with other reviewers that its great for tall ladies i dont think ive ever received so many compliments from strangers the lace is thick enough that your undergarment choice makes no difference but i was still comfortable on a hot day i wore a strapless bra the skirt is bit constricting because of the length but i could still walk dance and sit without much problem i loved wearing this dress and would highly recommend it","true to size on the fit i am petite and it came to the top of my knee the main downside with this dress was that my arms were very red and chafed by the end of the night after rubbing on the sequins ","fabric has stretch and is thick enough to cover flaws was comfortable and easy for dancing","loved this dress and got compliments i was wondering if the flowers on the dress were going to be gold or silver because i had seen other reviewers describe them as both they are really an in between color and will go with either gold or silver accessories i wore it with gold accessories and nude beige shoes if you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top i found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders even when i wore the smaller of my two selected sizes the dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types both theand thefit but thewas really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole thewas still a little gappy and i was going to try to fix it with fashion tape but i ran out of time trying to get the fashion tape right and ultimately i think it was fine to wear as it was","i didnt actually wear this dress as it was a skooch too big and i had no suitable occasion it was just a backup dress its pretty sexy though would definitely be great for a dressy event or a very fancy date i didnt love the billowy sleeves if i bought this dress i would take those in all in all b","first of all rtr contacted me the day this dress was supposed to ship and said it was no longer available they suggested i select a different dress but of course being the day before my rental was to start the selections were very limited and nothing looked right or exciting i had really been looking forward to renting this dress that was frustrating but they did agree to send my backup size anyway since it was available thankfullyim a bit bigger these days and the backup size fit perfecti agree with the suggestions to size up for backup the dress has no stretch the bodice is tailored fitted and very flattering the skirt starts at the natural waist and is really cool i loved the galaxy print its really pretty in personi was a little concerned that the front of the skirt would be inappropriately short but it wasnt i was very comfortable sitting and did not have to cover my lap overall this was one of my favorites ive rented and i would rent again if it wasnt sogot it at a discount ","due to stretch in the fabric i thought it ran a little large unfortunately my second size was not available for my date the color is beautiful more purple than burgundyfit is off the shoulders so i wore a strapless bra faell below the kneeor me fabric hides any flaws very flattering i will definitely rent again","i love red dresses and this is a great one for workit was loose which is great for everyday","husband actually had this on his list of favorites for me so i ordered it unsure of how id like it it turned out to be great it was romantic with a little sass on the lower half of the dress the material was nice and inside linedonly its delicate and can get wrinkly in places of packed up tightly overall very pretty","i rented this for a unique situation at a military ballsince my husband is deployed his unit was invited but the ladies were asked to wear cocktail dresses instead of a ball gowni wanted something comfortable that i could dance in but not look out of place with all the formals and this was perfectno shapewear necessary and bra friendly it does run very bigi am normally ain most items i rent because i am hourglass shaped but i was a perfectin this could have gotten away with alength was great got compliments all night i would definitely rent again","this dress fit beautifully for the most partid say it ran pretty true to sizei am normally aand the r fit right through the bodicethe only negative was the long lengthi amand even with inch heels the dress was a bit longi had to be careful not to step on it throughout the nighti did wear a nude strapless bra with the dressthere is not lining under the lace details but the back strap of the bra was barely visible through the lacei loved the colors of this dressthe navy was classic but the aqua provided a pop of contrast funthe even was a blacktie optional weddingthis dress was formal but the sleeveless and sheer skirt details made it a bit more casual than a formal gownperfect for a spring wedding","the smaller sizewas the better size for me but the zipper on that dress was extremely difficult to operate and the back of the dress had an area that might have been stretched or something because it bunched up the sizewas comfortable and flattering though the top was just loose enough that i needed to pin the shoulders to my bra strapsthe color is a rosegold more than a regular gold the fabric is heavy under all the sequinsit worked well for a late september wedding but i might have been hot earlier in the summer","this dress is sexy a little too sexy for the wedding i was at it has some stretch and the material is pretty thick which was nice i chose to wear theso i had some extra room and lengthit was still a little short imand the cutouts would have shown quite a bit of my bra so i wore sticky cupseven then i had some side boob luckily it was really cold so i wore my jacket most of the night","i had a lovehate relationship with this dress i love love loved the look and got tons of compliments but this is not the dress for busy girlsi amlbs with a f bust after reading other reviews idecided to size up i typically wear aand orderd ai wore thesince it fit my waist better but i ended up with the oh so lovely armpit boob overflow all night my other issue was the boning the boning ends just at your natural waist and was pretty uncomfortable so after a long night of dancing i ended up with a scab on my hip where the boning rubbed the length was perfect within heels of course being so short it didnt have the same dramatic highlow look like the model but i still loved it overall it was gorgeous and i loved the rich fabric and cut but bust girls be cautious","garment tape is a mustit doesnt lay at all like is hows on the model as others have mentioned so i took their advice and used garment tape on it wanted to love itwhile it fell flat it definitely grew on mei wore it to a formal rehearsal dinner in chicago in novemberi paired with strappy black heels and a black choker","perfect for a dinner cruise you have to try it to really appreciate this dress there are pockets that gives it a dressy yet casual look i just loved wearing it and received many compliments about it there is no cons it hides all the body imperfections and emphasizes on your best assets if your legs and chest are the best one you have","i didnt end up wearing this dress because it didnt arrive in time and there wait a hole on the bottom but i did try it on the waist area was fine but i found the chest area to be a bit large i did not wear a bra when i tried on this dress i also noticed i could get away withinch heels ","great flirty skirt but very shortfitted enough in the body and top to ensure no wardrobe malfunctions overall a great fun outfit","loved it the dress was very comfortable minus that it is a little tight around the waist but the entire dress was too big with the next size up i was able to wear a normal bra and it had a full skirt i felt the top was a little big my bust is small but it wasnt noticeable to anyone besides me it also tended to show a bit of cleavage when sitting down i also felt the length was good overall a win","this is a beautifully designed and well constructed dress on the hanger it doesnt look like anything special but when you put it on it comes alive especially if you have curves the lace was thick well constructed and sewn onto the solid lining so it doesnt shift amazing the darker color and lace overlay hide body flaws pretty well but i did pair it with spanx to smooth everything out i wore it with an adhesive bra as well to not have to deal with a traditional strapless straps would be visible through the lace if you are petite and or pear shaped like me this is a great choice since the shift style does not have a defined waistline and there was plenty of room in the hips im still in the process of losing the remaining baby weight and this dress was very forgiving while still looking sharp","this dress does not have a lot of give and tends to ride up the back has an interesting rectangular open shape but it gaped on me at hte bottom unless i yanked down hard on the skirt to keep it flat i didnt end up wearing this dress because i was going to be sitting at a wedding and it looked bad from the backthe front abdomen area also sagged on me but the pattern made it hard to notice i dont know if this was because the dress is worn out or its a design flaw it doesnt seem like the kind of dress thats supposed to have movement it looks great in photos from the front ","not sure how the crowd was going to accept my

recommend ordering your normal size then one size down as a backup","was a great fit no bra necessary if you do decide to wear a bra you cant see it wasnt itchy nor uncomfortable colors are darker than the pic they show you wasnt too short and defiantly pair it with a bright necklace to give it some pop ","it was perfect i have larger shoulders so it was a little tight there but it fit perfectly around my bottom the fabric was stretchy and comfortable and i got a ton of compliments i amwith a b and aboutlbs","its definitely a cute fun and playful type of dress i wasnt crazy about the materialit looked and felt different than id imagined from the online pictures and reviews it had a natural stiffness and poof to it that was unexpected but it was flirty and fun but not scandalously short or inappropriate for my friends wedding the top part was snug in the rib cage area so i opted to go up a size it was nice that you could wear a strapless bra underneath although i didnt even bother since the dress was snug secure and thick enough to go without a busty girl might want to avoid this oneim small chested and felt it was quite snug overall a cute fun dress for the evening","i loved the lace and scalloped straps very feminine i wore this to a friends th of july wedding and got a lot of compliments only con was i shouldve worn theinstead of theit felt a little

catch some of the lace on the sleeves which is the only reason the dress gotstars loved that the arms were covered","i ordered thewhich fit but the piping material in the chest area was a bit wonky i ended up wearing the backupwhich was fantastic im short and blonde pretty pale the color was beautiful and i was so pleased the hi low is an awesome design and i received tons of complimentsi definitely recommend this","fit perfectly","great dress definitely fits true to sizethey only had aavailable for the day i needed it and it worked out very wellthe color is definitely more of a neon

dress and i would definitely rent it again","wore this to the derby party huge hit what a great dress for vacation dinner date night summer partysuper comfortable and forgiving while being sexy at the same time wear with or without bra there is one built in so i didnt wear one cant go wrong with this dress colors are bright and vibrant no necklace needed with it either due to the amazing neckline ","i liked how this dress wasnt just flat boring black it has a cool textured fabric the straps are super loose but otherwise i think it fit very true to size you cant wear a bra with this dress because of the back and the fabric does have some stretch id recommend sticking with your typical dress size but sizing down for backup","i enjoyed wearing this hot dress that showed off curves perfectlyi felt like jessica rabbit in this onenote that i wore my backup size of sizeas opposed to the sizeand it was a bit tight in the legs but luckily i had very little walking too dosmall stepsi

dress","very comfortable stretchy in the bottom and fit well in the top","i got so many compliments both in person and all over my social media accounts when i wore this dress imand wore the dress withinch heels which was the perfect length for me the dress looks better in person than in pictures and the real color is a bit more of a rose gold than yellow gold the color is very suitable for many many skin tones even my pale complexion it was quite comfortable and light to wear my favorite part of the dress was how it was cuttheres a subtle curve to the dress to help emphasize the waist and a small widening of the bottom of the gown that lets the dress move sweep along with you as you walk rather than a straight cut that limits how wide a step you can take like with a column dress ","i rented this to wear for my daughters baptismits a great dress since you can wear a regular bra with itthe aline made it very easy to camouflage a lower belly pooch and wider hipsi loved how i looked in it so much i bought itits my favorite datenight dress","loved this dress it photographed so well for my engagement photos i ordered both the l and l the l was too short even without heels i

enough its a true showstopper the amount of compliments i received was crazy but even more gratifying was how amazing i felt in the gown the only other dress ive ever felt so beautiful wearing was my wedding gownthe bust on it was a bit big but it was a simple fix for me where i simply basted a couple of loose stitches on the inside which were easily removed before i sent the dress back or someone without sewing skills a padded bust cup insert would have been another good solutionthe dress was understandably very wrinkled when it arrived but was easy to steam iron for a perfect lookanother pro for this dress is that its so stunning you really dont need flashy accessories to complete the look strappy nude heels and a nice pair of earrings are all you needthe dress is comfortable to wear and light as a feather so even on a hot summer night would be a great choicei literally cant say enough positive things about wearing this dress love love love it","length was perfect for my height little

anything i loved i chose this as my last resort when the dress arrived it fit great however it ended up being a little too sparkly for my event the wedding was black tie casual however i was a guest

rental","gorgeous dress i got so many compliments and so many people already asked to borrow it wish i could keep it and wear it over and over definitely will rent again","this dress was exactly what i wanted for my event as noted by other reviewers the fabric is lighter than the average fulllength gown which made the dress breathable and easy to dance in i loved the double slits which added drama and movement the fabric is thin so it is not the best choice if you are looking for a bumpfriendly dress as for sizing it is true to american sizing not couture sizing so no need to sizeup i wore the r but would have probably been a little more comfortable in theoverall i really liked this dress and would recommend it","rented this dress for a party i got anbecause there was not aavailable i

while i couldnt bust out break dance moves i was able to dance without feeling completely restricted i am always a zero in dresses and this fit true to size im shortand i thought the length was perfect with a heel overall im very pleased with my order thank you rtr","it fit very well though it did ride up when i walked maybe i couldve worn thebut that dress had a paunch that could accommodate someone with a belly thewas oddly baggy in front overall i felt very pretty and confident good pick","this dress is a beautiful vibrant red so perfect for the holiday season it is elegant

could do it again i would order the long i amand the regular length just skimmed the floor the dress is incredibly comfortable dont bother with a bra unless you need the extra support because the dress is wellstructured on top ","love the open lace detail at the topgreat for a spring wedding","so many compliments and the dress fit really greathighly recommend for any wedding","really wanted to

comfortable flowy and flattering i felt good in it all night long and it was really easy to dance in i would gladly buy this dress to have on rotation for future summer wedding seasons ","the lace sleeve on the dress is incredible i caught myself staring at it a lot i had to add a skirt to the dress because i am really tall and the dress was barely covering my butt this problem is probably on the rare side however i can see this dress definitely working for a shorter girl anyhow the dress was beautifully made and i received a lot of compliments for my outfit i got lucky finding a skirt that matched perfectly but the dress looks very good with black tights if a skirt isnt an option since the dress is pretty basic besides the lace sleeve accessories are a must finding a good necklace or earrings will make this dress work so well basically besides the length problem this rental was a success and i would love to rent from rtr again it was really easy","there was a small error with my order so i was able to pick a dress that rtr overnighted to me for my event they ended up sending me this one and another so i wore one to the ceremony and one to the reception rtr went above and

of those areas the shoulder fit looked more sleeveless that strapless the extra fabric in front and back bunched up and just didnt work for me it looked almost like a mistakethat said the pictures of other women wearing it show a wellfitted and beautiful dress so i think it was just me or maybe my specific dress idk likelys red carolyn dress was a much better fit for me\n","this post has been a long time coming i rented this dress along with the blue version for my bridesmaids and holy moly its almost a year later and i still get asked about these dresses renting these dresses for my wedding

lighter gold color as well the waist band is true to size though ","the dress was classy i wore it to a formal lunch event and it fit great however the shoulders sleeves whatever you want to call it were awkward to me at first its kind of offtheshoulder but not completely anyway it was fine but i was selfconscious about keeping the straps at exactly the right level otherwise the material stretches in an unflattering way so i wouldnt rent it again if you plan on dancing or moving around a lot if you just need to sit and look pretty then itll probably be fine other wise the dress was really pretty and i received a lot of compliments one last thing i am busty and i was able to wear a strapless bra but i had to be aware of the dress slipping down at times and exposing the bra on the side not a dealbreaker but it wasnt a worryfree style for me ","i received this as a last minute backup when the dress i had ordered was suddenly unavailable it was more casual than anticipated due to

silver threading and accents i loved how it was backless as wellit was sexy without being too overthetop there were a few downfalls though and those ultimately led to me choosing the other dress ive got longer legs so the dress was pretty short on me the material also rode up a little bit so i would have been pulling it down all night if youre bigger chested youll need to wear a sticky bra as theres no support in the dress overall i felt gorgeous in the dress and if it were for a less formal party this was a military cocktail party i probably would have chosen it now i know how it fits though and will definitely be ordering this dress in the future","the s was snug but in a good way i wore a push up bra but this dress made me look like a c i wore spanx too overall great dress the

throughout the night you could also wear a cami underneath if you are concerned about the low neck line overall this is one of my favorite dresses that i have rented ","super flattering dress very

compliments all night on it i chose to size up from my normal size because of my mom hips i could have fit in the r but i was worried about it being too tight on my thighs hip area this dress is stunning the material isnt thin and not too thick i was on the fence getting this dress because of the cutout and because i am a mom of two young kids but the slit and the cutout wasnt bad at all it

dress and take off the blazer and it has tons of wow factorwould definitely recommend renting this dressthe only con\nand maybe this was just for methe zipper in the back does pucker a bit and this contributes to the dress riding up as you walki assume most folks dont mind thatbut it was a cold nightand i loved the elegant look of the dress at my kneesbut truth be toldnot a big deal at all","this was sent as a backup for a damaged dress and based upon the photos i was very disappointed by the stylists suggestionbut i loved it the blue is much brighter and the gold much more pronounced when you see it in person fit was very flattering creating a smooth hourglass figure with no spanx required i did end up purchasing a bra that had a full front but stickon sides and no back

certainly received compliments on it and the color was fun it looks pretty pink here because of the lighting but its more purple the only frustrating thing was that there was no way to wear a bra with it and unless you have a full enough chest the top will swallow you so i had to buy those sticky implants that actually worked really well to fill out the dress nicely and give me a little more

our dresses they were a great rose gold color that shimmered so nicely in the sunlight i would say this dress was a little tight around the rib cage all of the bridesmaids expressed the same

kneei was able to wear a regular bra with this dress which made it even more comfortable ","love this dress for shoulder season weatherflattering got lots of compliments super comfortablethe medium

had to size up to accommodate this ","ok this dress is stunning the fabric could not be prettier its a neoprene material by the way the pros are exactly how beautiful it is that it is really warm for winter and it has an overall very flattering fit it is rather short by the way so dark thighs may be a necessity it has some cons though the first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms the opening between shoulder and arm is rather large but then the fabric compresses the arm itself so it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder but not at the biceps area this was annoying and i felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that two other cons which are no big deal the sleeves are really long its ok for wearing it standing up but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up which is not very easy to do with this dress and also loses part ofits charm the second is that the dress is warm indeed so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot dancing or just being at a warm enough venue one thing which may interest some i wasmonths pregnant when i wore it and it does not compress the belly at all i was quite comfortable there in spite of the bump my discomfort was all because of the arms ","this dress was extremely comfortable and was so pretty i would definitely rent wear this again\ndont mind the sushi baby i have going on in this

waist but verrryy tight through the hips and legs it was very flattering especially if youre going for the figurehugging look but it was honestly pretty uncomfortable that is why i ended up wearing it

enough that you could go withoutthe color was a little deeper than pictured but it was very flattering on my skin toneit is very fitted but stretchy enough to move with younot the best dress for lots of dancing or stairs but worth it as i felt incredible in iti would definitely rent again","the dress was amazing and i felt so great wearing it i ordered both the r and r im a ddd so im always nervous about sizing fit but the r fit nicely and the adjustability of the open back helped the r fit as well but the straps were defectiveit was one combined strap as opposed to two separate straps you need two straps in order to loop through the back and i didnt want to cut the strap very odd but overall lovely dress ","i was so excited about this dressunfortunately it arrived in a r rather than the l i ordered and so it barely touched the floor when i wore flatsnot a good lookotherwise it is a beautiful classic silhouette and the beadwork on the shoulder is stunning","love this

worked perfectly for a girls night out on the town i could have worn either the s or xs but went with the xs for a more tight fitting look the fabric did not have much stretch though so arms were a bit tight and i was unable to wear a bra due to the cut of the front but the fabric was thick enough to be supportive overall a very fun dress i would definitely rent again ","this style runs a bit large so you should size down from your usual size for your back up it is better for larger busted women as there is a lot of room in that area the perfect dress for a holiday party this season pair with gold accessories and shoes ","this dress fit exactly as i expected it to and just like the photo very happy with the choice","i rented this through the unlimited program based on other reviews i knew this was a knit dress and a bit boxy the cut was flattering and i liked the pattern it was a bit short for work but black tights and tall boots made it work the one thing that bothered me was that because it is a knit the other colors show through the predominant color for exampleyou can see bits of pink and black in the white sections i wore it once and then returned it","did not fit","i received the alice dress as a backup option when my original dress was not available in the size that i ordered i ended up not needing it because the smaller size in my first dress worked fine however the alice dress is adorable and i would definitely wear it for another occasion as others have noted the arms are a bit snug but they are not so snug that i would avoid the dress altogether i like the length and shape of the dress i find it flattering and comfortable thank you to rtr for quickly sending another dress so that i had options","i wore this dress to a bridal shower in march and it was

woreinch heels with it and that worked really well the dress is stunningprobably my favorite dress i have rented highly recommend","the material is very similar to corduroyit also made the dress ride upi ordered a sizeandthewas way too small and thewas just uncomfortableit definitely runs small and not for a woman with curves","this dress was a pleasure to wearso comfortable","i got a lot of compliments on the dress but the zipper was a huge pain the dress fit great just a little uncomfortable for a long night of dancing based on where the boning hit me would recommend to friends for a night out","i loved this dress the fit was great it was super flattering the pockets were amazing it ran true to size the fabric was thick and luxurious would definitely rent again ","perfect but be

necessary i got tons of compliments from other women and even a kiss on the hand by a total stranger i felt amazing and confident in this dress but i have to mention that the material on one of the sleeves was torn away from the elastic band at the wrist fortunately it wasnt noticeable at all except for the random sequin that fell off from time to time","this dress is super cute it was perfect for a work party where i wanted to stay appropriate but special the lines were a little too straight so i used a belt to create more shape i have a big bust but this dress hid that pretty well im usually between aand abecause of the bust and thewas perfect","nice fit very low and a bit revealing straps were either stretched out or just too long the material sucked everything in very flattering","i wore this with leggings it is kind of short and doesnt sit at actual waist it is cute and the color is quite muted may rent again ","i wore this gown to my husbands army ball it had the right amount of sass and class to make me feel sexy yet tasteful i cant even count how many compliments i got when i wore it but a ton of people stopped me and i felt fabulous in it i originally ordered the size four and the size two as my back up after my night was over and the dress came off i realized i had worn the two and if fit fine a little snug but i didnt mind i was sad to send the beautiful gown back lol well worth the rent i would recommend this gown to any one ","great dress for a large bust","beautiful gown felt like beyoncé at the grammys the whole nightit was too long for me atwithinch heels","perfect fitruns true to size and is flirty but cute with the cutout sleeves and fuller cut skirtstill short enough to feel a little sassy but professionalwould certainly rent this againgreat material as well","fits well not a heavy skirt it was a little loose in the chest but the underarm fit snug enough that it wasnt gaping it was perfect for a black tie wedding","i was receiving compliments all night long the dress is super comfortable and fun to wear the shorter front makes it easier to walk while the longer train adds the glam the pleats and thicker fabric allow the dress to billow out too which is lovely i also loved the pockets one thing to point out is that the dress is quite heavy so if you plan on dancing be prepared to hold up your dress as people will step on your train i give this dress aout ofis because the dress had a bit too much room in the chest area for sizei am an a cup and there was room in the dress for a c cup at least i did read previous reviews that the dress was great for larger breasts but i assumed the size of the cup would be adjusted for sizestick on cups were my best friends that night ","i wore this dress to my fatherinlaws th birthdayi was running super late from work and had to jump into this dress in a matter of minutes and rush out the door i was super nervous it wasnt going to work out and i would have to find something else to wearmuch to my happiness the dress fit and i was out the door the dress is stretchy but form filling and fit like a glovethe only issued i had was the straps were too longthis was easily remedied by joining the straps with a small hair barrette at the base of my neck which i covered with my hairif i were to order again in the future i would try out thei highly recommend this dressit is a beautiful color and very comfortable i was able to wear a strapless bra with it by pulling the strap down low in the back","everything was great","fits like a glove no need to wear a brano zipper so dont put lotion on before squeezing in to the dressclassy easily dressed up or down i wore this to my boyfriends christmas party at heinz field wore the blazer because it was freezing cold but it really completed the look rent this dress you will love it","i rented multiple sizes as these dresses were used for a bridal party the overall look of the dress isstars and they fit true to size however i am only givingstars due to issues with the length of the l received the girl that wore this dress isand the dress was significantly above her ankles we ended up having to safety pin her dress so that it didnt look absolutely ridiculous she was the maid of honor so the fact that her dress was different actually worked out another bridesmaid who wore a l couldnt wear heels otherweise the dress would have looked to short on her so she wore flats maybe the dress we recieved was not truly a long just from what i saw if youreor taller this dress may be an issue length wise ","i am very indecisive and critical which makes picking a dress impossible but everything about this dress is perfect i amordered l and love to wear high heels the length was perfect the dress fit very snugbut i say that in a good way grabbed all all my curves perfectly but while it held everything init also had an incredible stretch to it that allowed me to walk freely take giant strides if i wanted to and dance rent this dress it will not disappoint ","the fit of this gown was spot on i am usually a sizedepending on the brand i ordered a l with a l as back up the sizefit like a glove as you can see the l was actually a little short the l was even shorter likeinches shorter bizarre im not all that tall aboutin bare feet my heels brought me up to aboutand the l still didnt graze the ground the l was unwearably short seriously i almost wish id gotten the xli was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves i have a very true hourglass figure with just a bit of a tummy this draping on this dress concealed everything im not kidding it also helped with my less than perfect armsthis dress has a good amount of stretch the only thing i wasnt crazy about was the amount of layers the pictures dont really showcase that the bottom has three layers one stops right at your bum so be careful if you are bottom heavyit will cut into you the second helps show less leg behind the slit and the top lies as you would expectoverall i would recommend this dress it was very comfortable and it didnt feel too heavy i am big busted ddddd and i was able to wear a spanx singlet and a normal braoverall i would definitely rerent this dress for a different occasion i would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel which are notoriously cold i was comfortable throughout the event while many of my friends complained of being cold ","i wore it to a resort casual wedding reception during the day and kept it on for a friends birthday in the city i got several compliments at both events the dress is short but comfortable it was a little big in the chest shoulder area for me but i needed theto comfortably fit my hips overall great dress ","i received this dress as a free backup because one of my previously selected styles became unavailable fortunately but also unfortunately i did not need to use this dress however i did try it on and loved it the fit was amazingi almost made my husband take me out again just so i had an excuse to wear it only complaint is that the lace looked extremely worn to the point that it looked dirty almost if the fabric was brighter and looked newer this would probably be the perfect dress however because of the worn look im not sure that i would pay to actually rent this dress againbummer","sucks you in in all the right places can wear eith or without a strapless bra imand thewas perfect ","this was an amazing experiencethe dress fit perfect and i received many honest compliments it was a chilly day and this dress kept me warm i danced all night long and i felt greatrent this dressyou will not be disappointedi amand lbs i wore a sizeit was perfect ","this dress is incredible its comfortable beautiful unique and moves wonderfully on the dance floor someone even asked me if i had it made for me i was able to wear a normal strapless bra with it although the bodice does fit snugly excellent for pears because their is ample room in the hips","this dress is an easy fit in a nice color its nothing overly revealing or flashyso it works perfectly when you need something as a wedding guest ive worn a r in every dress i have rented from rtr so far and this fit just as expected","this dress is awesome it looked beautiful on and the peplum is just enough not too big to add detail but still showcase your own figure","this is the second time i have rented this dress just in a different color the red is very bright and vibrate definitely good for a holiday or perhaps valentines day im small chested and didnt need to wear a bra and the top is tight enough that it actually gave me a bit of cleavage which was nice im very short so you can see that it was a bit longer on me than the model but with the top totally open it was a nice balance ","the fit this dress has a little bit of stretch to it so while i was afraid amight be too small for me it fit really nicely it runs a little bit largepros this dress is incredibly comfortable i wore it around nyc forhours and never felt like i couldnt move naturallycons it is a little bit short when you sit down but i used the cape to cover my legs ","it fit perfectlyi wanted to try the w but that size was not availablethe w was great and very comfortablei will definitely rent again","this dress fit me like a glovepetite friendly dress herve leger never disappoints the bandages keeps everything together and the top surprisingly did not keep falling down for me i am usually very small chested so i was surprised the top stayed but i did use fashion tape as an extra measure it is very tight so you will definitely need another person to help you get into this dress ","the lace on this dress is gorgeous although i received it brand new so it was in pristine condition love being the first to wear a rental lol there is an ivory slip underlay that is attached at the bust so it stays in place and the straps on the slip are adjustable there is also a little bit of crinoline under the skirt there are buttons on the sleeves which is a nice detail overall though i found the silhouette of this dress to be super boxy on me i have no hips though i sized up so maybe i would have been better off in a smaller sizeits classy and fun but does run short if your all leg like me sitting offers lots of leg view if your on a date but could keep you tugging down if youre at a wedding or family eventvery safe dress ","this dress was super unique and fit great i got compliments all night long i rented r and r ended up wearing thei amandlbs i was worried this dress would be too long but it actually was the perfect length grazed the floor with in heals on the material was thick enough so i didnt need to wear a bra i am a b for reference however there is no built in support overall i would highly recommend this dress ","i rented both theand theand while thefit better the snug waist caused the front pleat to kick out more than desired probably enough to trigger the when are you due questions so i went with theso the front pleat chilled out a bit addtionally i wore a thin black belt with it and used fashion tape to seal the pleat for the first few inches i adored the colour and print though and was able to wear a regular bra "," i love this dress from the moment i open the delivery satchel it is much more gold in person and is covered and pay yet the color is true gold this was perfect for mycasino royale party i got tons of compliments because if it was like a glove are usually wear a sizeand the actual large gave me room to dance there is no give in this dress and it can be a little warm because it is lined but with spanx it was perfect tons of compliments wish i could buy it ","id originally ordered another dress but luckily rtr sent me this one as a replacement it fit like a glovethe seams were incredibly flattering and the length was just right with low heels imbest of all it was incredibly stretchy i was able to dance all night with no shifting discomfort and tons of compliments if this dress came in other colors id wear it over and over again to every occasion","fit and flare style wasnt for me the bottom part of dress flares out quite a bit and made me look at leastsizes bigger than i am very unflattering fit for me however super cute dress in general was bummed this just didnt look good would try on first ","make sure to order a size down as it does run large it also looks great with tall heels since the back makes it a tad more modest ","i chose this dress as my last option because all my other options were already\nreserved but i can tell you i couldnt be happier the fit was perfect the dress\nreceived a ton of comments\nim always happy with whatever i order from rent the runway\nagain great choice\nsometimes zippers on all seem to be difficult to zip maybe from useage\n","the dress fit like a glove and with my large bust line it actually make it appear proportional to my body which was amazing i paired this with a pair of dove grey strappy sandals gunmetal crystal chandelier earrings and a bold fuschia lipthe dress was so amazing my dad insisted on buying it for me so that i could wear it over and over","fit like a dream a little tight in the chest but all my clothes usually are this hit right at the knee i got so many compliments on the color and on the little bow ","i typically wear an xs s and rented the xsr size small was not available for the dates i needed it was slightly snug at the neckline and bust but i think the size small would have been too large through the ribcage i loved the dress and the print is beautiful i got compliments on it all evening overall highly recommend this dress ","it fit perfectly even without a bra the details were gorgeous received so many compliments on this dress i am so happy that i went with this dress ","the back cut out of the dress was so cutei wore my normal size and still had some room to spare probably could have gone down a sizeit was comfortable and forgiving i would wear again","this dress is awesome it was everything i had hoped it would be im really glad i ordered the r and the r they werent too different except that the r had a bit more fabric bunching up right at the waistline unless you are a truei would highly recommend getting the r and the r as back up depending on the size of your bust sometimes i can wear adepending on the dress but i dont think thewould have fit me this dress is fun photographs well especially while dancing and twirling and made me feel so pretty look out for the long tulle back when getting out of vehicles or standing up from a seated position your heels can easily catch the back of the dress and tear the tulle ","i loved this dress it cinched perfectly in the waist and had some very nice detailing on the bust and waist it even has pockets the dress is low cut so expect to wear it without a bra it holds you in though so it should work out perfectly its a plain navy so i wore it with over the top earrings and a necklace ","rtr sent me this dress because the one i ordered wasnt available but i ended up really liking iti think it definitely runs a bit small tight in the hips but i wore spanx to smooth things out and it was finei did not wear a bra but you could definitely wear a sticky bra or maybe a straplessit was actually a bit loose in the top for me so if you are smallchested i would recommend wearing a sticky bra to fill it out a bit more i just forgot minei wore about inch heels and it was just long enoughso if you are tall or like wearing high heels id recommend a long the material is pretty stretchy so it was comfortable and easy to dance ini got a lot of compliments so i would say it was a success","had to return the dressi have a closet full of sizegowns as we do a fair amount of formal eventshad checked the size chart before renting and thought id be more than safe in aas ive even recently lost weightwas excited when the gown arrived only to put it on and not be able to zip up the backi had purchased a sizewhite house black market evening gown and it fit the same as this gownnot sure how others felt the sizing was but i even checked the inside of the dress to make sure i hadnt accidently been sent agorgeous gown well made heavy just didnt fit true to size","the only con i have for this dress was that the fabric was heavier than i thought it would be absolutely loved it other than that","the dress is gorgeous i got compliments on it all night long my beef with the dress is that the zipper sticks it stuck on both sizes in the same spoteven when i was not wearing the dress i had a panickyminutes when my husband tried to zip the dress for me right before we needed to leave ","the top was a little looser than i would have liked but there is a rubbery lining that helped keep it in place thicker material might have been a little warm for a wedding in julybut great color ","we attended a red carpet event and my dress stole tbe show heads turned towards me wherever we walked you cant be shy and wear this dress because everyone will notice you people literally stopped me for photo ops i felt as if i was the guest of honor my fiancé loved that my dress was such a hit lol i think this dress works best for curvesthe upper part was a tad bit too big for my chest but overall it stayed on and i had kept it pulled upso no wardrobe malfunctions i weighedand the l was perfect for my stilettos without my stilettos the dress wouldve dragged ","the neck hole is decently tight so i would size up one if you have a small chest you can get away with no bra always a plus the pleats are so fun and i got tons of compliments ","tight around waist","slimming sexy extremely flattering i am in love so comfortable felt amazing all night supportive enough to wear no bra love love love does not disappoint will rent again","i wanted to wear this dress to run errands and meet up for lunch unfortunately the length didnt cut it i usually do a bend test before heading out of the house and this dress failed for reference im just underbecause the piece is on the casual side im finding it difficult to figure out when would be a good occasion to wear it i might be sending it back without actually wearing it or accessorize it with a pair of capri leggings ","this would be the perfect canvas to showcase a big statement necklace or belt or amazing shoes etc however the dress by itself lacks pizazz i chose this as my backup option for a wedding because the mini dress long sleeve silhouette seems really fresh the dress is nice quality heavy fabric no bra required and not as short as the pics make it look this would probably be a flattering choice for curvy girls but it didnt do much for my figure ","awesome dress that made me feel like a million bucksgreat for large busts small waists would totally rent again","both theand thefit me but i ended up going with thebecause it didnt show as much chest there was more than enough room in the chest for even a large chested womanvery nice fabric and hangs nicely the tuxedo flap wasnt overboard and worked to help cover my problem area in the waist would highly recommend ","i loved this dress and got complements all night you will be the center of attention in itit sparkles a lot i loved the way it photographs and the fact that you can rent it i feel like this is the kind of dress that you want to wear only once it was perfect for a new years eve party in dc thank you rtr

the print is beautiful lots of compliments i highly recommend ","the dress fit well pretty true to size i usually wear a sizebut i am barrel chested so i needed thefor my chest despite being barrel chested my breasts are not really big so i used a safety pin to stop the gaping at the base of the cleavage imand ordered the regular however it was a little short so i couldnt wear my normal heels and had to opt for a kitten heel instead you will definitely need someone to help you zip this one up if you order it when the zipper hits the boning in the dress it takes some strength to get it over the boning and all the way up overall i felt absolutely glamorous i got so many compliments","this is not a dress i would normally choose for myselfi dont usually like strapless dresses on my body and pink isnt always a color i gravitate towardbut this dress was absolutely beautiful and flattering in every waythe fabric is sturdy and structured and the shape of the dress is incrediblei discovered the pockets after receiving the rental which was awesome at a wedding i got compliments all night long i cannot say enough about what a successful rental this was","the skirt is full and it has pockets the material is very high quality and not one bit flimsy the dress came on time and in perfect condition it did not look worn at all i am a d chest and i would recommend that bustier girls size up as a backup just in case i think it runs true to size but definitely not small so for the backup go a size up ","this dress fits all shapes and sizes perfectlyi ended up wearing the s and belting it as i thought the style as is was not flattering for my bodyjust throw on no zippers or buttons and goprint is great and soft for fallmaterial is midweight and silkyi can easily see this dress being dressed up or down depending on how you accessorize","went with another dress but wish i had another affair to wear this too bright color but not neon or overwhelming probably shouldve gotten anormal size aswas tighter around mid section pockets are great a fun dress for sure ","a little on the longer side hit at or below my knee very comfortable ","i wish i would have ordered the small and mediumi would have liked a tighter fiti wore this to s black tie optional wedding and was worried it wasnt fancy enoughhowever the wedding was outside and had a somewhat casual feel so it ended up being perfectthe material is very comfortable and givingim tall and this was the perfect length for me","lovcd the color and the fit got lots of compliments on the color and the sexy back would recommend a latch for the lower zipper it slipped down an inch two a few times when dancing sitting at a wedding slightly worrisome but definitely loved the dress came out great in pictures","i ordered this dress for a formal wedding and i absolutely loved it i am usually a sizebut wish i would have ordered athe zipper and top was very tight and hard to get up but it did loosen up as the night went oni got so many compliments on this dress and would definitely wear it againplus it comes in so many different colors","i wore this to a christmas party with red strappy heels the dress was very comfortable but like all dresses by designer it runs a size small i am usually abut always have to go with thehere the small worked perfectly and i got both the petite and the regularfor anyone around my height get the petite even in heels the regular was way too long the petite in heels just barely touched the floor on me ","fits true to size i have a larger chest ddd and wore a sizethe neck is pretty low and i kept fixing it throughout the night but other than thatsuper comfortable loved the sparkles got lots of compliments and felt awesome","this dress was beautiful but i may order a size down next time it was very spacious around the waist so much so that i needed to wear a belt loved the slight highlow ","oh my gosh this dress was a blast to wear and it was super comfortable it is short so if youre planning on doing a lot of dancing you wont be able to lift your arms above your head imfor reference i wore anbecause thewas too tight in the bust the lining is a little bit

better i was unimpressed with the fabric which i felt detracted from the quality of the dress it was a slinky mesh material so you could see every bump underneath it i didn’t wear any undergarments

felt it looked on me i received more compliments on that dress than i have ever before on any purchasei had men coming up to me saying the dress was stunning the auctioneer referred to me as the

beautiful deep green that was perfect for the occasionthe material was thick and did not wrinkle when packed in a suitcasethe cutouts were edgy but classyi was able to wear a normal bra with it which

the r and r in this gold one before i left to go to florida before the ball i tried on the r and it didnt fit my boobs so i figured i would have to wear the r which was a little too long but at that

dragged a bit but heels helped overall the secret pockets and the entire dress was extremely flattering ","i am always a little nervous with gowns since i am petite and narrow and many have a tendency to overwhelm my small frame this dress was stunningi received so many compliments on it at the gala i wore it to and the pattern is so unique the open back detail is also great although i wish there had been a set off additional hooks attached to make the crossstrap tighter it became unhooked a few times i ordered the petite as a backup but withinch heels it was a little shorter than i liked","i felt like a billion bucks loved this dress i was confused and a bit nervous after reading all of the reviews because i wasnt sure what to expect and didnt have a backup plan i did have to go a size up from myusual size and i wouldnt have minded a bit more length and would probably go with the long rather than regular length if i could do it again but it didnt matter that much because of the wraparound style and short skirt in front i wore edgy laceup shoes with my hair loose and bouncy to balance it all out it definitely has a gunmetal shimmer and works well with dark silvery accessories and at an event withpeople i never saw anyone else with the same dress on so i was happy about that my only complaint is that it doesnt have any stretch so its a bit confining but overall i loved it and would absolutely recommend it for any black tie affair","fits perfect very feminine ","wore this to a semiformal wedding and it was just perfect the material was quite thick which was nice for being on the ocean and for smoothing coverage as well as when it got cooler at night but if it had been any hotter it would have been too much fit true to sizewore it withinch wedges and it was the perfect length","i go so many complements on this dress the whole night it was a formal event but there was a lot of dancing involved the fact that the dress is actually so short kept me from becoming a hot mess while still looking elegant its slim fitting so be ready to suck it in with any size you get its a long dress and it would have been dragging if i didnt have heels on ","the dress fit wellboth theandi went with the larger size as it looked a little better the scuba material is great the dress was incredibly comfortable and super flattering fun to dance in for a wedding fit a larger bust well i felt very put together and the painted floral print felt special","as previous customers have said the fit is slightly bigger so those who wear a sizecould probably fit into a sizeas i did the dress is pretty but i would definitely dress it up with a nice necklace as it is a little plain i was going to wear a shaper underneath but i didnt needed it as the dress had some give in the midsection i loved the fact that you could unzip the sleeves and found it added an extra flare to the dress the arms were a little snug but not uncomfortable and when the sleeves are unzipped it gives a little extra room i would recommend hanging up the dress as soon as you get it as the back end wrinkles pretty easily ","you can dress this up or downgreat for vacation or around the town leisure","the dress hugs you and give you a rest shape without being too tight and uncomfortable color is vibrant and beautiful i will rent it again","this dress was the perfect fit for a wedding the dress code of which was formal or fabulous i got compliments on it throughout the evening it was comfortable enough to dance the night away though some of the sequins near the arms rubbed unpleasantly

the loud floral print but the placement of flowers really ended up highlighting rather than hindering","i am a true sizeand this dress ran big i had to wear it with a belt for a more flattering fit i love the scalloped lace on the neckline but it was a bit frayed bent due to normal wear tear i amand wore it withinch heels but it was still a bit longer than i had hoped overall i would recommend it for a girl that is a bit taller and bustier","my only complaint was that the size recommendation was that i would fit in a long dress perfectly but in reality the l was aboutinches too long i amand woreinch heels and i still had to hold the dress up all night to keep from draggingotherwise the fit was absolutely perfect for me ","because im more of a pear shape it wasnt flattering on me this is a more natural waist style although the dress was very pretty just wasnt as flattering as my back up style that i ended up wearing ","i liked this dress overall the fit was a little off for methe hips were tight but the bust was a little loose in the medium and sizing up to the large made the bust and arms baggy so i stuck with the medium the dress wasnt constricting which was great for dancing

hem makes this a special dress so i left it alone","i amand tend to worry about lengththis dress hit mid thigh and was a great lengthnormally i wear a sizebut i found that thefit more comfortably and was more flatteringi also dont have a large chest so thehad too much fabric in the chest and would have fallen and revealed my bra every time i movedboth zippers were a bit sticky but with my husbands help we got them upon shorter women expect this dress to hit around the knee still pretty but i think with all these sequins youd be going for a sexier look","very comfortablefabric very similar to clover canyon dressesthe skirt is linedthe size small fit well for reference im sizeoccasionallyif very fitted through hips and hit just above the knees on mework appropriate i got complements all day","first of all im so happy rtr has plus size now ive been wanting to rent forever but nothing would ever fit me i ordered this dress in w and w thinking id definitely be wearing the w ehhh wrong i

wouldnt be concerned because i have pretty big arms and they were fine also the dress is a little on the short side so if youre a bigger girl and your legs arent your strong point you may want to consider a different dress or wear black tights i wore the tights overall this is a beautiful dress the color is much more gorgeous in person and i got a lot of compliments its heavy and wellmade and it was so nice to wear a dress i really loved rather than settling for some lane bryant dress that i only bought because it fit ","this dress is simple but the color gives it style i added a statement necklace and wore it to a south beach chic party i also wore it with just a blazer to a work event it ran true to size and was good for my petite frame its a solid rental dont expect compliments or head turns but do rent if you want a versatile piece that you can personalize with layers and or accessories","i got this dress for prom but ended up wearing my back up it looked great on once i got it on the zipper was a pain and even without wearing it the zipper was hard to get up i was expecting there to be some room to move but there was no stretch or anything and was a bit tight on me so because i was changing out of it in the middle of the night i decided to go with my other dress because the zipper was so much easier and fit better but it is a beautiful dress that id recommend sizing up if you rent it","had a hard time giving it back really flattering ","this dress was very effortless it had more sparkle than anticipated but it was not too much you will need double sided tape to prevent any slips ","i read other comments and sized down to a small and i am glad i did it was loose but flattering and was so comfortable i wore it with flats and a leather jacket ","a perfect combination of elegant and sexy the dress hugs all the right areas the top was slightly big but still looked fine i wore abut probably could have even worn a","i ordered this one as a backup

it","i absolutely loved wearing this dress and received many compliments on it from the color to the fit i would highly recommend this dress to any woman who is looking for something that will make you feel glam and curvy im glad i got the medium as this dress is meant to be form fitting and on the tighter side i couldnt even get the small past my thighs so go a size up if youre undecided it also kept its shape all day and night and didnt stretch out like other dresses ive worni didnt wear underwear or a bra but did wear pasties up top the dress fits tightly enough that i knew my girls

amazing in it i had to wear it and in person it is really classy i received compliments all night and it was comfortable as well the boning is not restrictive in the stomach so sitting down to a full meal is not a problemi wore the long withheels which was perfect at the beginning of the night but seemed to get longer as the night went oni understand the comments about the sequins chafing but it didnt really bother mei am usually unhappy with my pear shape but loved how i looked in this dress","i was wavering between true to size and large the fabric is stretchy and it probably runs a bit big but i wouldnt have ordered down a size i think if i had ordered a two it would have been tight in the bust the extra fabric wasnt unflattering and if anything made it comfortable nicely made dress","\nim so in love with this dress that i may treat myself and buy it its very comfortable and the material is nice and heavy but still moves well it definitely runs big but since its loose fitting to begin with the size didnt look off its a classic fit and can easily be dressed up with heels and jewelry or kept fairly casual for something less fancy it was perfect for a work event not

stuck in the center","bright slightly shiny dress with a great fit i did not end up wearing this dress because even for late spring in the northeast it was too bright for the event but would wear it to a different event the neckline is more modest than it looks here and the length is great pockets are always useful the armholes were a little smaller than normal but it wasnt a problem for me if anything it prevented armpit fat from spilling out","this dress was gorgeous i received tons of compliments it was also quite comfortable ","i wore this dress to a wedding and it was perfect there were a few snags and such in the tulle but nothing noticeable i got so many compliments on it it runs true to size definitely recommend this dress for any wedding or gala","this dress is so unique and vibrantly colored i ordered in sizesthe only downside to myexperience was that the sizecame without the liner had a rip in the mesh in a very noticeable place and was strangely too large on me

was i ended up wearing my backup size of l which fit like a glove imlbs with awaist i have an athletic build so was concerned my back wouldnt fit luckily it forgiving and unlike other reviews i did not find it irritating under the arms the downside for me was that the dress arrived ripped along the bust area the rtr team gave me the options available but none involved the dress i had wanted for so long so i ended up doing some small stitches to hold it together its such a beautiful and unusual dress i promise you will have endless compliments and feel classy and glamorous ","after reading

wear them crisscrossed i contacted the rtr customer service who suggested sizing down i did that and ended up wearing theit fit great i wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day the top is fitted so that helped to keep everything still while i was on the dance floor too the dress was casual enough for a daytime outdoor ceremony but also dressy enough for the party the material is heavy and eleganti received compliments all day long i have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt i would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently

look like a million bucks","this dress fit perfectly and hugged my body in all the right places it was comfortable and easy to move in i have a larger bust and i felt like my chest looked fabulous not

especially for a sizewhich was a little big on me but still worked id say this dress is great for a curvy woman with a large chest and hips luckily i was able to tie the back tight enough that it pulled the chest area in for me had it not been for the print it would have been noticeable that it was large in the chest area you cant wear a bra with it but because the material is printed you dont

made this a little playful and sassy the sequins up top the silky pleated skirt and the crop look with illusion mesh some dresses make you work to wear them but this dress isnt its like wearing that comfy sweaterwhere you dont have to worry about bra straps sticking out sheer material for an oops moment too long trails etcbut you still get to look fabulousfor sizing i think i could have even gone

dressstars out ofbecause of a few cons its not possible to wear spanx because of the mesh on the side so if you want a little extra smoothing that is not an option the vneck was very low cut which

and hip area i usually wear a sizebut wore the sizeand it was perfect you need to buy a backless strapless bra for this dress because the ivory lace back and inset on the front are see through its a

places for bra straps black sneakers and a black leather jacket very comfortable but i still felt very sexy for work i wore it with a black velvet blazer polka dot tights and black flats would have preferred with black pumps but my back is out right now very versatile dress would definitely purchase if i had more money","the original dress i ordered wasnt available so i had to pick this

wore two inch heelsit was a bit snug in places but that is they way it is supposed to fit because it looked right and wasnt uncomfortablethe material is heavy and stretchy so very comfortable and gives warmth at a winter partythe slit lets you show some leg which gave this simple dress a little splash of sexy","i wore this to a wedding it has the classic lbd look elegant but the leg slit

thought it was a little short for what i would be comfortable with but i wore it anyway for a daytime eventprobably not long enough to wear to work thoughas other reviews have stated there is no

dragged a littleit made it seem more elegant and covered my feet","the color of this dress is absolutely gorgeousi received so many compliments on it the fit was very flattering as well the only con was that i did have some serious zipper issues on both dresses i ordered the p and p and the p fit me like a glove however when it was time to put the dress on the zipper busted completely and i had to wear thewhich was too large at topif it werent for the zipper issues i would have definitely given this rental five stars\n"," months pregnant for a black tie wedding\nusually wear ar but this dress r fit perfectly this was actually a backup dress as my original dress came damaged but ended up working out top was a little big and low back didnt make it possible to wear a bra but i would

at one of the better local restaurants too it was too big but fabric was very comfortable and flatteringknit but not too clingy and it hung so beautifully that it still looked good arrived brandnew with tags on great pick rtr","fit it very tight but in a flattering way just make sure you are aware it will be exact so you may want to get a size bigger just in case the straps in the back pops out a bit so make sure to keep a nice posture after that super sexy everyone loved it specially my boyfriend so ladies it is an awesome dress to rent ","i rented theand thei was sure i was going to wear

to have chosen this dress not only because it looked great but it was so comfortable","the lace and color of this dress are beautiful in person also great quality this dress does i believe run true to size but i didnt really care for the way it fit me im a pear shape i have a small upper body and tiny waist with full hips and the bottom of this dress got weird and bunchy whenever i would move the only time i loved it is when i was standing still and could smooth it out also i wore a strapless bra and it kept poking out a little of the bottom of the top part still gave it five stars because it was beautiful just dont think i had the best body for it ","the sleeves are not really sleeveslots of breezy room for outdoorsits synthetic material and it smelled a bit funky from others body odori hung it up outside for a day to help with thatalso discovered a bit of a food stain on the hem lap areaoverall it was a great dress for two conferences","the dress fit perfectly through the hips and waist the shoulder straps where a little loose so once the dancing started i wished id thought to secure them with some fashion tape the dress is very low cut which showed off plenty of cleavage but perhaps a little too much for a work shindig i attempted to tape the front with fashion tape but sequins dont adhere very well so about an hour in i gave up the fight against bustyness","pros very classy and sexy not to heavy\ncons it was tight around my armsand the bottom kept catching on my heels","this dress was comfortable flattering and appropriate i loved it and definitely recommend","beautiful dress and true to size i amso ordered the long however i barely got away withinch heels in this dress which was very surprising to me the material doesnt scratch your skin something i was also worried about the dress doesnt cling to you so it is very flattering overall very happy","this dress runs a little large so i wore awhen i normally wear aorthe neck does fit tight however with the use of a clear rubber band you can extend it so that it fits more comfortably the dress was long on me hit right at the ankles but it still looked great with heels and i received a lot of compliments i also used fashion tape to keep the front of the dress from popping open when i sat down which i recommend ","a little double sided tape solved the problem of it falling off the shoulders i do agree with others that it was an issue however this is very comfortable i felt like a work of art ","i really liked this dress but i could have gone a size smaller for the bust areai pinned the top to reduce the low v and i used fashion tape to ensure the sides didnt expose too much mostly while dancingthe long length worked out well with heels which i usually do not wear given my height","imand it was short enough to be sassy without showing too muchtaller women might feel that it is too shortoverall flattering and comfortable","i amand my biggest worry about this dress was it would be too long and look too corporate for new years evebut it was perfect just short enough to be fun without showing too much wasnt too big on the bust i am a b c but wasnt super tight either i have hips and a butt so i chose to size up and wear theinstead of thejust so i could drink and eat that night but thefit very similarly just a smidge snugger on the hips the pockets are always a plus and the material was super soft felt like a brushed cotton it also had a stretch to it which also added to the comfort level the sleeves werent too tight also and i have slightly more muscular arms for my size overall a great dress you can wear to a work event a wedding or a party ","i rented this dress and the same dress in blue previously and love them it is a little snug in the arms but the fabric has some stretch so it was just fine the color is vibrant and you can wear a regular bra with the dress definitely would rent again","super short but super fun i had to wear it with leggings because even slightly raising my arms revealed a little too much but it was still really cute i actually liked the shoulder pads lending a little more structure to a dress that could look really heavy

was a little nervous that the dress wouldnt fit but this dress was perfect the v neck gave the elegant dress a touch of sexiness the sequins didnt scratch me or catch my hair like i thought they would

shower which it was perfect for it fit well in the shoulders and thighs but was a bit too big in the waistthe bow on the back is cute probably a bit much considering its already a pink lace dress but

scrunching was beautiful and very flattering the strapless top felt secure and i really only pulled it up out of habit would recommend for any formal event ","the fit of the dress was pretty true to size i like dresses that have a tighter fit up top but usually with that it means that it is hard to move around with this dress however even with it being tight it was still easy to move around the only issue i had with this dress was that the zipper was a little messed up so it took a little bit of time to get on but other than that it was great the only thing i would mention is it was just long enough for my feet to be covered in flats so if you like heels your feet might show a bit","this dress is beautifulthe color is stunning much prettier then the photographs and it fits very true

out a little bit making for a weird bump on my butt ","this dress made me feel gorgeous it is incredibly sexy without actually showing anything it runs small and very tight around the knees making it very difficult to dance in i rented the sizeandthedid not come close to fitting but i also noticed the red skirt bleed onto the white collar making it pink luckily i wore thebut for the price to rent

dress was fabulous i reserved theandbuy chose to wear thebecause it fit my hips better i received so many compliments it shows a lot of cleavage so you may want to pin the top regarding the zipper it

wearheels without tripping on the hemthe details on the top are very pretty and the skirt with gorgeous pleats and subtle split in the front is simple but eleganti could easily see renting this dress

this out to the wedding as planned also my husband didnt like the dress he didnt understand the mixed patterns haha thick fabric hid imperfections except tummy and my butt looked awesome in it ive been looking at other dresses by this designer hoping to find one thats better","the quality of the sequins the fulllength arms are amazing and general construction of the dress is great i knocked offstars for the ruching i feel like it looks artfully scrunched in the model photo but at my height and curves i felt it made me look much thicker around the waist i dont think sizing up would have helped because the ruching would have still hit me at the level of my stomach my hips butt definitely pushed more of the folds up but it might have just had something to do with my medium height and proportionswearing stockings tights nylons is impossible because the sequin hem will shred themi would have adored this dress and never given it back if it would be the same sequins arm neck but with a bodycon or or more tailored body with zero ruching","this dress was definitely too big on me however this was a last minute rental and my size wasnt available so i ordered a size up so knew that it

a lot of compliments would definitely recommend","i am usually anbut ended up wearing the ten thezipped up and made my boobs look better but thewas more comfortable i will say the only negative is that it was very large on top im a d and the dress didnt lay flush to my chest it gaped out a little not enough to be noticeable but enough that they didnt look as perky as they would if it had fit properly i didnt wear a bra and the material was thick enough so there was no nipple action i think this dress looks gorgeous on every person here who has posted a photo i strongly recommend it just

kept getting complements all evening the color was perfect for a day wedding and evening reception i wore it with nude heels and simple jewelry the beading around the neckline is enough but it wouldve been lovely with a diamond necklace as welllilly doesnt disappoint when it comes to the cut and fit of their dresses this fit wonderfully and the cut provided an hour glass shape that looks great on all shapes and sizes you can wear with regular under garments and the dress while form fitting never felt tight even while dancing i was so sad to send this one back","did not like the fit on the cap sleeves it also stuck out on one hipbummergreat looking dress ","this dress fit perfectly i am usually a p and this dress fit true to size i amand woreinch heels and the dress barely brushed my toes in the front the color was unmistakable and i was the only one wearing red at the wedding which made this an unforgettable dress it was very comfortable to dance in this dress fit snugly in the bust waist and hips as i get a tad bloated after eating drinking this dress did show this by the end of the night so i would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly i did not wear a bra nor spanx with the dress as the material is very sensitive in the rear and would have shown the spanx outline so i decided to take them off there is built in wiring lining in the waist and bustcustomer service was extremely helpful my first choice dress was damaged so i could choose another dress and when that one did not fit they overnighted me this dress ","wore this to a wedding in santa barbara in november it was unseasonably cold so the long sleeves and thick fabric were great i loved this dresscolor and fit are fantastic length hit just at my knees the details were great","fit true to size had an extra clasp on bust so no need to wear a bra not a ton of give to the dress but still fit nicely def would rent again","this dress was sent to me as a backup and i didnt end up wearing it as it was not a good fit for me it fit around my waist but was very tight then the top of the dress was very loose on my boobs it was actually uneven on top too one side sticking out a little bit more than the other as you can see in the picture mostly i just thought the overall look was very unflattering it was longer than i thought it would be too and hit at an awkward place right above the knee instead of looking like a voluminous mini skirt i wish it looked the way it does in the picture but it didnt on me ","the medium weight was perfect for a fall wedding in boston i paired with a nude heel since the color was so unique very comfortable and flattering to wear i did not have any issues with the sleeves being too tight but i could not comfortably lift my arms above my shoulder height because it would pull up the rest of the torso fabric in an awkward way not really a big deal for a semiformal wedding","i wore this to my a company holiday party in san diego i ordered theit did not come in time so ended up having anovernighted to me this dress is definitely short as people have already said but it is so beautiful i would have done better in thesince i am small up top wearing thewas a little bit loose and the sleeves fell down a few times but i loved this dress too much to care the sequins didnt bother me and it was just enough sparkle for the night definitely recommend ","i rented this with unlimited and wore a white button up underneath for work cute and comfortable","this dress is lovely i rented it for a hip yet formal fall wedding two of our closest friends were getting married and my husband was asked to officiate in order to play “preacher’s wife” i feel like i had to step up my gameafter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding i attended as an adult i’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few dillards jams over and over desperately trying to style them into something fresh enter rtr and this lil beautypros gorgeous detail lace for days great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business beautiful open back and delicate chest detail love the two pintucks on the front also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling tons of compliments looks pretty with pearls as well awesome to dance in both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling outcons i’m gifted in the booty department so i was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum the waist was defining but not as dramatic as i would have liked i also have a smaller chest and found that i needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top the lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain so watch outhmm there’s a bustierinlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived but i was able to make it work without iti’m still giving this thing abecause i loved my rtr experience and i see this dress in my dreams we already miss each other come back to me shoshanna dress ","this dress fit welli tried both the sizeand sizeand could have worn either onevery comfortable dress and easy to wear i absolutely loved this dress\nupdate i rented this dress a second time for my husbands work party atpounds the sizefit much easieri really wish this would be available for purchase","loved this dress received compliments on it all night and felt great when i rented they only had the long left so i just hemmed it with hem tape since i was wearing toms only problem was that the zipper was extremely difficult to get up and down where the middle section comes together in the back my fiancé had to use pliers and even then it took a lot of work it was a little tight in the chest area im a dd but not too bad sad to see this dress go back ","i loved this dress it was so beautiful and received complements throughout the night i ordered awith aas my backup size and went with thethewas a little snug around my bottom half but thewas a bit loose at the top i could have gone with either i just preferred to have the top fitted so that the layer under the lace wouldnt dip too low i ended up wearing a strapless bra with this the back is high enough that its covered but i also probably could have gone without one the dress was definitely longer on me that it is on the model but the picture i included makes it look an inch or two longer than it actually wasas an aside about rtr i had scheduled the dress to arrive the day before i had to fly out for the wedding but the ups center lost power and the dress hadnt come before i had to leave i called rtr in a panic and they had the dress in both the original and backup sizes overnighted to my hotel for no extra charge they didnt have the earrings i had ordered so they sent me an upgraded pair on top of all of this the person i spoke with at rtr was so incredibly kind and made everything really easy id recommend this dress and rtr to anyone","this dress was perfect i couldnt have loved it more it was definitely a knock out and i received compliments all night","this dress fits like a glove and the fabric is thick enough that it doenst show bumps etci thought it was super flattering and really comfortable it is a great way stand out in a sea of black dresses i paired it with black wedges and a creme pashmina for an outdoor late summer wedding","i wore this dress for prom i absolutely loved it it was actually my backup dress and the only size available was anwhich i am butis better for some dresses not all at first the zipper would stop around the waist area but i got it eventually it fit me like a glove i received so many compliments and i really stood out the slits added a nice touch the only downfalls was that it was a little too long i am heals made it a little better the slip underneath wasnt really a problem i had to pull it down once or twice i was not able to wear underwear with it and i wore a backless bra it was an awesome dress that was very fitting and snug","fit just a bit small i usually wear a

i just preferred to have the top fitted so that the layer under the lace wouldnt dip too low i ended up wearing a strapless bra with this the back is high enough that its covered but i also probably could have gone without one the dress was definitely longer on me that it is on the model but the picture i included makes it look an inch or two longer than it actually wasas an aside about rtr i had scheduled the dress to arrive the day before i had to fly out for the wedding but the ups center lost power and the dress hadnt come before i had to leave i called rtr in a panic and they had the dress in both the original and backup sizes overnighted to my hotel for no extra charge they didnt have the earrings i had ordered so they sent me an upgraded pair on top of all of this the person i spoke with at rtr was so incredibly kind and made everything really easy id recommend this dress and rtr to anyone</td>\n      <td>dress</td>\n      <td>5' 5\"</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n

for the fabric to close on my body and it was extremely difficult to zip up on the body and on the hanger i also thought it was a touch long i amand hadinch heels on and ordered a regular it was a little long and i needed to lift it some when tackling stairs other than that i loved the dress i dont normally wear strapless much but the sweetheart cut works great \n7                                                                                                    the dress was gorgeous but unfortunately i was unable to wear it due to some quality issues which the renttherunway team was excellent at handlingi would recommend going upsizes from your usual dress size if you have a larger bustit also runs on the long side imand even withinch heels it dragged a little too much for my preferencethe colours are rich and true to the picture the fabric is forgiving when it comes to wrinkles so its a dress that travels very well\n8

mixer it definitely stood out in a sea of black suits i paired this dress with a classic black blazera belt \n9

and typically wear a sizei ordered aand thewasnt even close to being able to zip up ended up wearing theand it was still snug i would recommend sizing up with this dress cut and color are beautiful and classy fabric is thick and hides your flaws would love to buy this dress\n10

is too small and vice versa but in this instance the bottom fit but i couldnt get the back strip to connect so i had to essentially wear it as a backless dress it worked but was not ideal it was also much longer on me than shown on the model\n11

               the dress is absolutely gorgeous unfortunately the dress proportions were off for my height i would have loved to wear this out but i couldnt because the lengths were awkward on my body \n2     even though it was lined with satin this was a light beachy dress that was still formal enough for this casual beach weddingitsbackless though so you cant wear a bra and because the neck is such a scoopneck it makes the neckline a little strange if you have a chest and dont wear onei ended up getting one of those stick on bras and the dress looked much betterits much pinker than the model picture which was a pleasant surprisepretty dress comfortable just a little awkward fitting in the chest area if you have anything larger than an abuy the stick on bra\n3

that the length is a little odd so it made walking up stairs and getting into the car a little difficultimlbs and the medium fit perfectly\n4

even on the hanger it was very tricky to zip up i had plenty of room for the fabric to close on my body and it was extremely difficult to zip up on the body and on the hanger i also thought it was a touch long i amand hadinch heels on and ordered a regular it was a little long and i needed to lift it some when tackling stairs other than that i loved the dress i dont normally wear strapless much but the sweetheart cut works great \n7                                                                                                    the dress was gorgeous but unfortunately i was unable to wear it due to some quality issues which the renttherunway team was excellent at handlingi would recommend going upsizes from your usual dress size if you have a larger bustit also runs on the long side imand even withinch heels it dragged a little too much for my preferencethe colours are rich and true to the picture the fabric is forgiving when it comes to wrinkles so its a dress that travels very well\n8

                           i wore this dress for an attorney mixer it definitely stood out in a sea of black suits i paired this dress with a classic black blazera belt \n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the fit of this dress runs small imlbs and typically wear a sizei ordered aand thewasnt even close to being able to zip up ended up wearing theand it was still snug i would recommend sizing up with this dress cut and color are beautiful and classy fabric is thick and hides your flaws would love to buy this dress\n10

    usually the issue for me is that if the top fits the bottom is too small and vice versa but in this instance the bottom fit but i couldnt get the back strip to connect so i had to essentially wear it as a backless dress it worked but was not ideal it was also much longer on me than shown on the model\n11

It can also serve as a foundation for more in-depth analysis.\n\nFor this task, we will utilize the `pipeline()` function from the Hugging Face library, specifically with the [\"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) model. This model is a smaller, general-purpose language representation model that excels at text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis.","metadata":{},"id":"2ced1e75-77d5-4eb4-b288-3c958cb9dae0","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### The `pipeline()` function can help as achieve this.\n\n- Instantiate a new pipeline object for `sentiment-analysis`.

can be utilized for various NLP tasks. While the sentiment analysis pipeline above used a default model, we can choose any model from the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) to better suit our data. For instance, [FashionClip](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip) is a model specifically trained for fashion-related datasets and tasks, making it a great fit for this dataset.\n\nThe [`pipeline()` module](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) in Hugging Face is highly versatile. It supports multiple transformer pipelines across different domains, including NLP, computer vision, audio, and multi-modal tasks. Within NLP alone, it covers 12 different tasks such as sentiment analysis (listed as \"Text Classification\"), Named Entity Recognition, Summarization, Conversations, and Q&A.\n\nBy leveraging the appropriate model and pipeline, we can enhance the performance and relevance of our analysis, ensuring that the tools we use are tailored to the specific characteristics of our dataset.","metadata":{},"id":"f29a4b73-3939-4722-87dd-b495f271e5a5","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Now, we're going to understand the distribution of the sentiment of review texts via a histogram.

It seems like the amount of positive reviews increased dramatically in 2021. Potentially a revamp of the customer experience, product quality, more customers, or something else we don't have data for. \n\nFrom a business context, digging into the common words/n-grams of the positive reviews can be revealing as to what customers love about the products. Doing the same for the negative reviews can be just as informative for what they don't love (i.e. sizing issues, rental service, etc.). \n\nWe will look into that soon. But first, let's test the previous comment on preprocessing text. Does it matter for sentiment analysis?\n\nIn this step , we will build another sentiment analysis pipeline but, in this case, for the non-cleaned `review_text`.

This is a positive outcome for us! It indicates that we can use the original text for further analysis without significant loss of accuracy. However, it's important to remember that this is situation-dependent. Always weigh the benefits of cleaning text versus leaving it as is.\n\n### Understanding Transformers in NLP\n\nTransformers, such as those available on Hugging Face, are a crucial component of machine learning and deep learning models designed to process sequential data. They utilize a mechanism known as \"self-attention\" to understand a specific token (word) by considering other tokens (words) in the sequence (sentence).\n\nIn simpler terms, transformers—especially those trained on very large datasets—perform well on unstructured, un-cleaned text because they take the entire sentence into context. Each word contributes to the overall understanding of the sentence. For a deeper dive into this concept, refer to the [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07531.pdf), which elaborates on this point.\n\n### Benefits of Using Transformers\n\n1. **Time-Savings**: Transformers can significantly reduce the time required for data preparation. This allows for quicker analysis and decision-making.\n2. **Leveraging Unstructured Text**: With less hassle in data preparation, more unstructured text can be utilized, enhancing the robustness of the analysis.","metadata":{},"id":"127a022a-dc2a-454f-bb90-b6bbfc24e3c6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Embeddings","metadata":{},"id":"a8a780ba-d690-4fcc-90d3-3e73e1419d50","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In the next task, we will switch gears to exploring another common use case for Hugging Face and transformers - **text embeddings**.\n\nEmbeddings, in a very simplistic definition, are vector (numerical) representations of data within n-dimensions. In this context, we are focusing on text embeddings. Each transformer model may produce embeddings with a different number of dimensions. Embeddings are powerful because they translate human language into a format that computers can process, enabling advanced functionalities such as similarity detection, text generation, semantic search, and more. These capabilities are extremely valuable for various business applications, including recommendation systems and search functionalities within websites or product catalogs.\n\nWe will now apply this concept to the `rented for` column using the `sentence_transformer` [package](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers). Specifically, we will utilize the BERT-based [\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2), which is designed to map sentences and paragraphs to n-dimensional vectors.

While higher-dimensional embeddings can capture intricate relationships between words, they can pose challenges for certain tasks, such as clustering. This is due to the \"Curse of Dimensionality,\" which can degrade the performance of clustering algorithms in high-dimensional spaces—a common issue in text mining and NLP.\n\nTo address this, dimensionality reduction techniques are often employed. These techniques help in calculating distances (e.g., Euclidean) between embeddings more effectively, which in turn facilitates better clustering.\n\nTransformers are designed to excel at learning context, meaning that similar texts—whether they are words, sentences, or documents—will have similar vectors and thus be closer together in the embedding space. This proximity can be leveraged to identify which products, users, reviews, etc., are similar to each other.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships is a crucial step in building recommendation systems, as it allows for the identification of similar items or users, thereby enhancing the recommendation process.","metadata":{},"id":"0810760f-0c27-4145-ad6d-b5689c2285ac","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Now we 'll conduct dimensionality reduction using the `TSNE` module from the `sklearn` package.\n\n- Import `TSNE` from `sklearn.manifold`.\n- Create a new TSNE object using the defined input parameters.

a two-dimensional space. This reduction from the original high-dimensional space (e.g., 384 dimensions) to just two dimensions is necessary for human interpretation. The color coding in the plot indicates the type of item rented, such as \"dress\", \"gown\", or \"sheath\".\n\nFrom the visualization, we can observe two main clusters in the dataset for the \"rented for\" column. One cluster is predominantly blue, representing gowns, while the other is mainly orange, representing dresses. This clustering provides insights into how customers rent items for different types of occasions. For instance, gowns might be rented more frequently for formal events, while dresses might be chosen for semi-formal or casual occasions.\n\nThis example, though simple, is quite informative. It demonstrates how embeddings can reveal patterns in customer behavior and preferences. Beyond visualization, embeddings are crucial for facilitating \"semantic search\". Semantic search involves searching with meaning and context, aiming to understand the user's intent and find the most relevant results. This contrasts with \"lexical search\", where the search engine looks for exact matches of the query or its defined variants. Both search methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and further research into their applications is encouraged.\n\nIn a customer experience setting, semantic search can be incredibly powerful. It can enhance recommendations by identifying products similar to those described in reviews or product descriptions.
