    "## Introduction: Smarter Driving with LLMs and RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "As automotive technology continues to advance, so does the need for **intelligent, real-time driver assistance**. With dashboards becoming increasingly complex, drivers often face challenges in understanding unfamiliar warning indicators and technical alerts. To address this, we explore the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with vehicle manuals using a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, resulting in a **context-aware chatbot** that can assist users in plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are acting on behalf of a **well-known car manufacturer** looking to embed LLMs into their vehicles. Your task is to build a proof of concept that enhances the traditional user manual experience by allowing drivers to **ask natural-language questions** and get **accurate, actionable answers** directly based on the car’s official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is the **MG ZS compact SUV**, whose **warning message manual** (stored as `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`) contains detailed descriptions of dashboard alerts and their recommended actions. Using tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini**, and **vector-based retrieval with Chroma**, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and process the HTML manual.\n",
    "- Embed the text into a searchable vector database.\n",
    "- Implement a RAG pipeline that matches user queries with relevant manual content.\n",
    "- Generate informative, concise answers using a chat-based LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project not only serves as a **smart assistant** for understanding car warnings but also paves the way for **voice-enabled, AI-driven interfaces** in vehicles. The final goal is to connect this chatbot with **text-to-speech software**, offering a fully **hands-free driver support system** in future automotive applications.\n"

    "This project demonstrates a compelling proof of concept for integrating **LLMs with technical vehicle documentation** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. By leveraging the MG ZS warning message manual and OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini, we created a **context-aware chatbot** capable of interpreting complex automotive alerts and providing **clear, human-like responses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parsed and embedded car manual content into a vector database.\n",
    "- Enabled accurate, real-time information retrieval using LangChain and Chroma.\n",
    "- Built a natural-language interface that understands and responds to driver queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system lays the groundwork for more advanced in-car technologies. In the near future, this chatbot could be extended with **text-to-speech capabilities**, enabling it to **read answers aloud**, enhancing accessibility and reducing driver distraction. Additionally, the approach can scale to other manuals, languages, and brands, forming a **modular support tool for any smart vehicle system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project shows how **modern AI and NLP techniques** can turn static documentation into **dynamic, interactive, and context-aware support systems**, improving the user experience and driving safety.\n"
