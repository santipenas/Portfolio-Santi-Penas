# 🚀 Data Science, Machine Learning & AI Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science, Machine Learning & AI Portfolio**!  
I’m **Santi Penas**, a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with a deep passion for **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, **NLP**, and **Python backend development**. In this repository you’ll find a curated collection of my hands‑on projects—from foundational data analysis to cutting‑edge AI agents—each designed to showcase my technical versatility, analytical rigor, and love for building real‑world solutions.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I combine a background in business and sales with full‑stack programming and data science expertise. My career journey has taught me how to:
- **Translate** complex requirements into practical, data‑driven products  
- **Design** robust ETL/ELT pipelines and scalable backends using Python (Flask, FastAPI)  
- **Analyze** and visualize data with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly  
- **Build** classic ML models (scikit‑learn, XGBoost) and deep networks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- **Engineer** NLP solutions and fine‑tune state‑of‑the‑art LLMs (Hugging Face Transformers, GPT series)  
- **Orchestrate** Generative AI flows and RAG pipelines with LangChain, Pinecone & Cohere  

I thrive on solving meaningful problems, from exploratory data analysis to deploying intelligent AI services that integrate seamlessly into production.

   Foundational EDA and summary analyses (Jeopardy, NBA trends, e‑commerce funnels).  
3. **Data Science & Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Data‑driven storytelling (online dating profiles, flight data, mushrooms).  
4. **Machine Learning Projects**  
   Supervised & unsupervised models: classification, regression, clustering, hyperparameter tuning.  
5. **Deep Learning & Neural Network Projects**  
   TensorFlow & PyTorch networks: life expectancy, EV charging demand, hotel cancellations.  
6. **Statistics, Testing & A/B Testing Projects**  
   Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, real‑world AB tests (e‑commerce, pricing).  
7. **Big Data Projects**  
   PySpark pipelines analyzing Common Crawl and Wikipedia clickstream data at scale.  
8. **Time Series Projects** *(coming soon)*  
   Forecasting, anomaly detection and temporal pattern analysis.  
9. **Building Chatbots**  
   Notebook guides to create AI assistants—AlienBot & Cantina ChatBot—using Python.  
10. **NLP, LLMs & Generative AI Projects**  
    - **PDF Summarizer Apps** (Hugging Face Spaces & OpenAI+LangChain)  
    - **Text Generation & Hyperparameter Tuning** (DistilGPT‑2 exploration)  
    - **Speech & Literature Analysis** (Presidential speeches, syntactic patterns)  
    - **Aspect‑Based Sentiment & SMS Classification**  
    - **RAG & Streamlit Apps** for fast, conversational retrieval pipelines  
11. **Python Practice & Utilities**
